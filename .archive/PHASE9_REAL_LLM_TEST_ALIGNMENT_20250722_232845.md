# Phase 9 Real LLM Test Alignment Report

## Summary of Mismatches and Resolutions

### 1. Test Name Mismatches
**Issue**: Test function names didn't match test_expectations.json

**Resolution**: Renamed tests to match expected names:
- `test_supervisor_real_task_decomposition` → `test_task_decomposition_quality`
- `test_supervisor_real_orchestration_behavior` → `test_o3_reasoning_visibility`

### 2. Extra Test Created
**Issue**: Created `test_supervisor_real_resource_management` which wasn't specified for Phase 9

**Resolution**: Added `@pytest.mark.skip` decorator with reason that resource management belongs in Phase 17 (full integration)

### 3. Test Focus Alignment
**Issue**: Tests were broader than the focused behavioral tests suggested in INTEGRATION_TESTING_PLAN.md

**Resolution**: Enhanced tests to focus more specifically on:
- **test_task_decomposition_quality**: Focus on decomposition intelligence
- **test_o3_reasoning_visibility**: Added specific checks for o3 reasoning patterns like "step", "consider", "because", "therefore"

### 4. o3-Specific Behavior Testing
**Enhancement**: Added more specific assertions for o3 model behaviors:
- Check for reasoning steps in task context
- Look for systematic approach markers
- Verify reasoning patterns specific to o3's step-by-step approach

## Current State

The Phase 9 real LLM tests now correctly align with:

1. **test_expectations.json**:
   - Has exactly the two expected test names
   - Third test is skipped with clear reason

2. **INTEGRATION_TESTING_PLAN.md**:
   - Tests focus on behavioral validation
   - Tests are designed to run with minimal token usage
   - Tests verify o3-specific reasoning patterns

## Recommendations

1. When Phase 17 is implemented, the resource management test can be unskipped and moved to a Phase 17 test file
2. The tests now properly validate o3's reasoning visibility as specified
3. Test names match expectations for automated reporting

## Test Execution

Run the aligned tests with:
```bash
pytest tests/integration/test_phase9_supervisor_real.py -v --real-llm
```

Expected output:
- `test_task_decomposition_quality`: PASSED (verifies intelligent task breakdown)
- `test_o3_reasoning_visibility`: PASSED (verifies o3 reasoning steps visible)
- `test_supervisor_real_resource_management`: SKIPPED (belongs in Phase 17)
