# AI Co-Scientist Specification Task

Read all materials in specs-source/ and any existing work in specs/.

Your task: Implement the FIRST UNCHECKED item from SPECS_PLAN.md by creating
CLEANROOM specifications (implementation-free behavioral specs).

## Requirements:
- Focus only on WHAT the system does, not HOW
- Define clear interfaces and capabilities
- Specify expected inputs/outputs
- Document behavioral contracts
- Follow the guidelines in specs-source/guidelines.md
- Consider the scientific method and research workflow

## Process:
1. Read SPECS_PLAN.md to find the first unchecked [ ] item
2. Study all relevant materials in specs-source/, including:
   - ai-coscientist-blog.md and ai-coscientist-paper.md
   - All figure images (AICoScientist-*.png)
   - guidelines.md for specification patterns
3. Review any existing specs in specs/ for context and consistency
4. Create a new specification file in specs/ with appropriate naming
   - Follow document organization from guidelines.md section 6
   - For Phase 7 specs, consider documentation architecture patterns
5. Update SPECS_PLAN.md to mark the item as complete [x]

## Specification Format:
- Use clear section headers
- Include YAML frontmatter with metadata
- Define interfaces using BAML when appropriate
- Include relevant examples and edge cases
- Document error handling behavior

## Key Elements to Specify (as relevant):
- Core behaviors and responsibilities
- Communication protocols (for multi-agent specs)
- User interaction points (for interface specs)
- Safety and ethical boundaries
- Integration interfaces (for extensibility)

Write your output to specs/ folder.
