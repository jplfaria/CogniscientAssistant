# Safety Implementation Approach

## The Issue
The safety evaluator tests are triggering API safety filters, preventing implementation.

## Recommended Approach

### 1. Abstract Test Cases
Instead of using specific examples, use abstract placeholders:
- Replace specific dangerous scenarios with generic labels like "UNSAFE_SCENARIO_1"
- Use benign academic examples (mathematics, physics simulations, climate modeling)
- Focus on the evaluation logic, not the content

### 2. Implementation Strategy
- Start with the evaluator logic using only safe examples
- Test with mathematical and computational research goals
- Add configuration files for actual safety patterns separately
- Keep test data generic and academic

### 3. Next Steps
1. Implement ResearchGoalEvaluator with abstract logic
2. Use only benign test cases (math, physics, climate science)
3. Store actual safety patterns in separate config files
4. Focus on the framework, not specific dangerous examples

This approach allows building the safety framework without triggering false positives.
