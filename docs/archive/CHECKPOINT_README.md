# Workflow Reset Checkpoint

This checkpoint was created after implementing workflow improvements to address implementation issues.

## Checkpoint Details
- **Tag**: `workflow-reset-checkpoint`
- **Commit**: 55f7bd9
- **Date**: Created after resetting and improving the implementation workflow

## What's Included
1. **Clean state** - Reset to commit efcd6ba (before any implementation)
2. **Improved CLAUDE.md** - Test-first development, no exit after plan creation
3. **IMPLEMENTATION_RULES.md** - TDD guidelines and quality gates
4. **run-implementation-loop-validated.sh** - Script with quality enforcement
5. **Updated prompt.md** - Enforces test-first and quality requirements

## How to Return to This Checkpoint

If you need to reset to this clean state:

```bash
# Save any work you want to keep
git stash

# Return to checkpoint
git checkout workflow-reset-checkpoint

# Create a new branch from checkpoint if needed
git checkout -b new-implementation-attempt
```

## Quality Gates Established
- All tests must pass before commit
- Code coverage must be â‰¥80%
- Test-first development required
- One atomic feature per iteration

## Ready to Start Implementation
Run the validated implementation loop:
```bash
./run-implementation-loop-validated.sh
```

This will enforce quality gates and prevent the cascading failures seen in previous attempts.
