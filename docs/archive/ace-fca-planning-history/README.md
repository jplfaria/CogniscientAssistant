# ACE-FCA Planning History Archive

This directory contains historical ACE-FCA planning documents that have been superseded by newer, more focused implementation plans.

## Why These Plans Were Archived

These documents represent important research and planning phases in the development of ACE-FCA (Advanced Context Engineering - Focused Context Analytics), but have been superseded by more actionable and consolidated plans.

### Archival Date: September 28, 2025

## Archived Content

### 2025-09-21-initial-plans/
Contains the initial component-specific plans:
- `context-relevance-scoring-plan.md` - Early relevance scoring approach
- `baml-context-compression-plan.md` - BAML-based compression framework

**Superseded by**: Current comprehensive plans in `/docs/ace-fca-plans/`

### 2025-09-25-comprehensive-plans/
Contains the 4-part comprehensive planning documents:
- `comprehensive-ace-fca-integration-plan.md` (Parts 1-4)

**Superseded by**:
- `co-scientist-context-engineering-plan.md` - Actionable implementation plan
- `ACE-FCA-ROADMAP.md` - Strategic roadmap
- `consolidated-context-plans.md` - Lessons learned

## Current Active Plans

**Location**: `/docs/ace-fca-plans/`

### Primary Implementation Plan
- **`co-scientist-context-engineering-plan.md`** - Main implementation plan for applying ACE-FCA to Co-Scientist framework
  - 4 phases, 10-12 iterations
  - Detailed success criteria with automated and manual verification
  - Complete code examples and BAML integration
  - Follows proven pattern from successful development loop implementation

### Strategic Overview
- **`ACE-FCA-ROADMAP.md`** - Complete roadmap from development loop to Co-Scientist framework
  - Implementation status and technical architecture
  - Success metrics and risk management
  - Future enhancement roadmap

### Lessons Learned
- **`consolidated-context-plans.md`** - Key insights from development loop implementation
  - Proven results (66% context reduction)
  - Critical success factors and implementation guidelines
  - What worked well and what to avoid

## Successfully Completed Implementation

**Location**: `/thoughts/shared/plans/`

- **`2025-09-25-development-loop-ace-fca-integration.md`** - Successfully completed development loop optimization
  - Achieved 66% context reduction (exceeded 30-50% target)
  - Maintained 100% quality with comprehensive fallback mechanisms
  - Serves as reference pattern for Co-Scientist implementation

## Historical Value

The archived documents contain valuable research, technical exploration, and strategic thinking that led to the current focused implementation plans. They demonstrate the evolution of ACE-FCA from theoretical framework to practical implementation.

Key historical insights preserved:
- Early technical exploration of context relevance scoring
- BAML compression framework research
- Comprehensive system architecture planning
- Risk analysis and mitigation strategies

## Access Current Plans

To work with current ACE-FCA plans:

```bash
# Navigate to active plans
cd /docs/ace-fca-plans/

# Primary implementation plan
cat co-scientist-context-engineering-plan.md

# Strategic roadmap
cat ACE-FCA-ROADMAP.md

# Implementation lessons
cat consolidated-context-plans.md
```

For implementing the Co-Scientist ACE-FCA integration, use the structured success criteria format in `co-scientist-context-engineering-plan.md` with the `/implement_plan` command for iterative implementation.
