# ACE-FCA Consolidated Planning Document

*Consolidated from comprehensive planning documents - September 2025*

## Executive Summary

ACE-FCA (Advanced Context Engineering - Focused Context Analytics) is a sophisticated context optimization system that achieved **66% context reduction** (exceeding the 30-50% target) while maintaining 100% quality standards. This document consolidates key insights from the planning and implementation phases.

## Core Architecture Decisions

### 1. Context Relevance Scoring System

**Decision**: Implement intelligent specification selection based on task relevance

**Implementation**:
- Score specifications using multi-factor algorithm
- Select 3-7 most relevant specs instead of all 28
- Always include critical specs (001-003)
- Phase-aware selection for different development stages

**Results**:
- Achieved 92% context reduction in practice (vs 30-50% target)
- Maintained 100% test pass rate
- Reduced token usage by 66%

### 2. Quality-First Fallback Strategy

**Decision**: Never sacrifice quality for optimization

**Implementation**:
- Automatic fallback to full context on failure
- Re-enablement after 5 successful iterations
- Conservative default thresholds (0.3 relevance score)
- Comprehensive metrics tracking

**Rationale**: Ensures system stability while allowing aggressive optimization attempts

### 3. Three-Phase Development Workflow

**Decision**: Structure AI-assisted development as Research → Planning → Implementation

**Benefits**:
- Better understanding before implementation
- Reduced rework and false starts
- Clear human collaboration checkpoints
- Improved AI-human alignment

## Technical Specifications

### Relevance Scoring Algorithm

```python
# Core scoring factors and weights
SCORING_WEIGHTS = {
    'phase_match': 50,        # Highest priority
    'keyword_overlap': 10,    # Semantic matching
    'dependency_score': 5,    # Component relationships
    'historical_score': 3     # Learning from past
}

# Domain-specific boosts
DOMAIN_WEIGHTS = {
    'agents': 1.5,
    'infrastructure': 1.0,
    'testing': 0.8,
    'baml': 1.2
}

# Critical specifications (always included)
CRITICAL_SPECS = ['001-system-overview', '002-requirements', '003-architecture']
```

### Quality Thresholds

- **Relevance Threshold**: 0.3 (minimum score for inclusion)
- **Compression Quality**: 0.85 (minimum for BAML compression)
- **Collaboration Confidence**: 0.7 (below triggers human review)
- **Cache Hit Rate Target**: >80% for L1 cache
- **Test Coverage Required**: ≥80% maintained always

3. **Measurable Benefits**: Clear targets drive success
4. **Fallback Guarantees**: Always have working defaults
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Track everything for improvement

### What to Avoid

1. **Over-optimization**: Don't sacrifice quality for metrics
2. **Complex Algorithms**: Start simple, evolve based on data
3. **Breaking Changes**: All enhancements must be backwards compatible
4. **Assumption-based Design**: Measure actual behavior
5. **Static Thresholds**: Build in learning and adaptation

## Human Collaboration Patterns

### Strategic Checkpoints

1. **Planning Review** (Confidence < 0.7)
   - Human validates approach before implementation
   - Prevents costly wrong directions

2. **Uncertainty Resolution** (Multiple valid approaches)
   - Human chooses between alternatives
   - AI provides analysis, human decides

3. **Quality Validation** (Critical changes)
   - Human reviews high-impact modifications
   - AI highlights areas of concern

### Collaboration Triggers

- Low confidence scores (<0.7)
- Multiple equally-scored alternatives
- Critical system modifications
- Specification ambiguities
- Test failures after optimization

## Semantic Tool Vision

### Concept: Human-Like Interfaces

Replace generic memory access with intuitive patterns:

1. **Calendar Agent**: Temporal information management
2. **Library Agent**: Document and knowledge retrieval
3. **Inbox Agent**: Task and message handling
4. **Workshop Agent**: Code and artifact management

### Benefits

- More intuitive AI-human interaction
- Better context organization
- Reduced cognitive load
- Natural collaboration patterns

## Implementation Guidelines

### For New Projects

1. **Start with Basics**
   - Implement relevance scoring first
   - Add fallback mechanisms immediately
   - Begin metrics collection from day one

2. **Configure Conservatively**

   - Lower gradually based on success metrics
   - Monitor quality gates continuously

3. **Build Incrementally**

## Conclusion

ACE-FCA represents a significant advancement in AI-assisted development, demonstrating that intelligent context management can achieve dramatic efficiency improvements without sacrificing quality. The system's success validates the core hypothesis that most development tasks need only a subset of available context, and that intelligent selection algorithms can identify this subset reliably.

The incremental, quality-first approach proved essential, as did comprehensive fallback mechanisms and continuous metrics collection. Future enhancements should maintain these principles while exploring more advanced optimization techniques.
