# Consolidated ACE-FCA Context Management Plans

> Consolidated from multiple planning iterations - September 2025
> Preserves valuable insights while eliminating redundancy

## Preserved Insights from Previous Plans

### From Context_Effectiveness_Tracking_Implementation_Plan.md
- **ContextMemory System Analysis**: 2,201 lines with sophisticated functionality
- **Metrics Collection Framework**: Quality gates integration patterns
- **Storage Architecture**: File-based persistence with conflict resolution

### From BAML_CONTEXT_COMPRESSION_PLAN.md
- **15 BAML Functions Identified**: Production-ready integration points
- **Agent Coordination Patterns**: Memory-intensive workflow analysis
- **Compression Opportunities**: Hypothesis and review data optimization

## Implementation Status Matrix

| Component | Status | Plan Location | Priority |
|-----------|---------|---------------|----------|
| Context Relevance Scoring | Ready | docs/ace-fca-plans/context-relevance-scoring-plan.md | High |
| BAML Context Compression | Ready | docs/ace-fca-plans/baml-context-compression-plan.md | Medium |
| Human Collaboration | Needs Design | TBD | Medium |
| Semantic Agent Tools | Needs Design | TBD | Low |

## Next Phase Priorities

1. **Execute Context Relevance**: Implementation ready, immediate benefits
2. **Design Human Collaboration**: Strategic checkpoints and validation patterns
3. **Plan Semantic Tools**: Agent interface enhancement patterns

## Lessons Learned

- **Specification Authority**: Must preserve spec-driven development approach
- **Quality First**: All optimizations must maintain 80% coverage and test compliance
- **Incremental Enhancement**: Build on proven patterns rather than replacement
- **Measurable Benefits**: Context reduction targets of 30-50% with preserved quality
