# ACE-FCA Context Optimization Guide

**Advanced Context Engineering - Focused Context Analytics** for AI-Assisted Development

## Overview

ACE-FCA is an intelligent context optimization system that dramatically reduces token usage in AI-assisted development workflows while maintaining code quality. It achieves **66% context reduction** by intelligently selecting only the most relevant specifications and documentation for each development task.

## Why Context Optimization Matters

As projects grow, the amount of context (specifications, documentation, code) that needs to be provided to AI models grows exponentially. This leads to:

- 🚫 **Token Limit Issues** - Hitting model context limits
- 💰 **Increased Costs** - More tokens = higher API costs
- ⏱️ **Slower Response Times** - Processing large contexts takes longer
- 📉 **Reduced Accuracy** - AI models perform worse with overwhelming context

ACE-FCA solves these problems by intelligently selecting only the most relevant context for each task.

## How It Works

### 1. Intelligent Specification Selection

ACE-FCA analyzes your current development task and scores all available specifications based on:

- **Phase Relevance** - Specs related to current implementation phase score higher
- **Keyword Matching** - Semantic overlap between task and spec content
- **Component Dependencies** - Related components and their specifications
- **Historical Effectiveness** - Learning from past optimization success

### 2. Dynamic Context Generation

Based on relevance scores, ACE-FCA:
- Selects top-scoring specifications (typically 8-12 out of 28)
- Generates an optimized prompt file (`optimized_prompt.md`)
- Maintains full context as fallback (`prompt.md`)
- Tracks metrics for continuous improvement

### 3. Quality-First Fallback

If implementation fails with optimized context:
- Automatically falls back to full context
- Re-runs the task with complete specifications
- Temporarily disables optimization
- Re-enables after 5 successful iterations

## Usage in Development Loop

### Default Behavior

The development loop automatically uses context optimization when available:

```bash
# Standard usage - optimization happens transparently
./scripts/development/run-implementation-loop.sh
```

### Checking Status

View current optimization status and metrics:

```bash
# Check if optimization is enabled
./scripts/development/run-implementation-loop.sh --status

# View detailed optimization report
./scripts/development/run-implementation-loop.sh --report
```

Sample report output:
```
📊 Context Optimization Effectiveness Report
============================================
📈 Usage Statistics:
  • Total iterations analyzed: 47
  • Optimization usage rate: 72.3%
💾 Context Reduction:
  • Average line reduction: 66.0%
  • Average spec reduction: 64.3%
```

### Manual Control

Enable or disable optimization as needed:

```bash
# Enable context optimization
./scripts/development/run-implementation-loop.sh --enable-optimization

# Disable context optimization
./scripts/development/run-implementation-loop.sh --disable-optimization
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Configure ACE-FCA behavior via environment variables:

```bash
# Enable/disable optimization (default: enabled)
export CONTEXT_OPTIMIZATION_ENABLED=true

# Set relevance threshold (0.0-1.0, default: 0.3)
export RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD=0.3

# Set fallback trigger (consecutive failures, default: 2)
export FALLBACK_FAILURES=2

# Set re-enablement threshold (consecutive successes, default: 5)
export REENABLE_SUCCESSES=5
```

### Domain Weights

Customize relevance scoring for your project in `src/utils/context_relevance.py`:

```python
DOMAIN_KEYWORDS = {
    'agents': ['agent', 'supervisor', 'generation', ...],
    'infrastructure': ['queue', 'memory', 'storage', ...],
    'testing': ['test', 'pytest', 'coverage', ...],
    'baml': ['baml', 'llm', 'prompt', ...],
}

DOMAIN_WEIGHTS = {
    'agents': 1.5,        # Boost agent-related specs
    'infrastructure': 1.0, # Normal weight
    'testing': 0.8,       # Slightly lower weight
    'baml': 1.2,         # Moderate boost
}
```

## Metrics and Analytics

### View Optimization Metrics

```bash
# Generate human-readable report
python src/utils/optimization_analytics.py --report

# Get latest metrics
python src/utils/optimization_analytics.py --latest 10

# Export as JSON for analysis
python src/utils/optimization_analytics.py --json
```

### Metrics Tracked

- **Iteration Count** - Total development iterations
- **Optimization Usage Rate** - Percentage using optimized context
- **Context Reduction** - Lines and specs reduced
- **Phase-Specific Performance** - Effectiveness by development phase
- **Quality Correlation** - Success rate vs optimization level

### Log Files

Metrics are logged to:
- `.context_optimization_metrics.log` - CSV format for analysis
- `.implementation_logs/` - Detailed iteration logs

## Best Practices

### 1. Let It Run Automatically

ACE-FCA is designed to work transparently. For most development:
- Leave optimization enabled
- Let the system handle fallbacks
- Review metrics periodically

### 2. Monitor Early Iterations

During project start:
- Check optimization reports frequently
- Adjust thresholds if needed
- Ensure quality gates are passing

### 3. Phase-Appropriate Usage

- **Phases 1-3**: Minimal optimization (foundational specs needed)
- **Phases 4-8**: Moderate optimization (component-focused)
- **Phases 9+**: Aggressive optimization (agent-specific)

### 4. Handle Special Cases

For complex cross-cutting tasks:
```bash
# Temporarily disable for complex refactoring
./scripts/development/run-implementation-loop.sh --disable-optimization

# Re-enable after task completion
./scripts/development/run-implementation-loop.sh --enable-optimization
```

## Troubleshooting

### Optimization Not Working

Check if optimization is disabled:
```bash
# Check for disable flag
ls -la .context_optimization_disabled

# Remove to re-enable
rm .context_optimization_disabled
```

### Poor Context Selection

If relevant specs are being missed:
1. Review task description clarity
2. Check relevance threshold setting
3. Consider adjusting domain weights
4. Review recent metrics for patterns

### Fallback Loop

If constantly falling back to full context:
1. Check implementation quality issues
2. Review specification completeness
3. Consider increasing relevance threshold
4. Analyze failed task patterns

## Technical Details

### Files Generated

- `optimized_prompt.md` - Optimized context for current task
- `prompt.md` - Full context fallback
- `.context_optimization_metrics.log` - Performance metrics
- `.context_optimization_disabled` - Disable flag (when present)

### Relevance Scoring Algorithm

```python
score = 0
score += phase_relevance * 50      # Phase matching (highest weight)
score += keyword_overlap * 10      # Keyword matching
score += dependency_score * 5      # Component dependencies
score += historical_score * 3      # Past effectiveness

# Apply domain boost
if domain in task:
    score *= DOMAIN_WEIGHTS[domain]

# Select specs with score > threshold
selected = [spec for spec in all_specs if score > threshold]
```

### Quality Guarantees

ACE-FCA maintains quality through:
- **Conservative Defaults** - Errs on side of including more context
- **Automatic Fallback** - Full context always available
- **Quality Gates** - All tests must pass
- **Metrics Tracking** - Continuous effectiveness monitoring
- **Self-Healing** - Automatic recovery from failures

## Performance Impact

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Relevance Scorers

Implement custom scoring logic:

```python
from src.utils.context_relevance import SpecificationRelevanceScorer

class MyCustomScorer(SpecificationRelevanceScorer):
    def score_specification(self, spec_path, task_info):
        score = super().score_specification(spec_path, task_info)

        # Add custom logic
        if 'critical' in task_info['description']:
            score *= 2  # Double score for critical tasks

        return score
```

### Integration with CI/CD

Use context optimization in automated pipelines:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Run Development Loop with Optimization
  run: |
    export CONTEXT_OPTIMIZATION_ENABLED=true
    export RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD=0.4
    ./scripts/development/run-implementation-loop.sh --status
    ./scripts/development/run-implementation-loop.sh
```

### Metrics Export for Analysis

Export metrics for external analysis:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load metrics
df = pd.read_csv('.context_optimization_metrics.log')

# Analyze optimization effectiveness
optimized = df[df['optimization_used'] == 'true']
print(f"Average reduction: {optimized['line_count'].mean()}")
print(f"Success rate: {optimized['success'].mean()}")

# Export for visualization
df.to_json('optimization_metrics.json', orient='records')
```
