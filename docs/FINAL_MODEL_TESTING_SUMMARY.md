# Final Model Testing Summary - AI Co-Scientist Platform

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive testing confirmed critical model-specific requirements that must be handled in the AI Co-Scientist platform:

1. **O3 (gpto3) silently ignores max_tokens** - Must use max_completion_tokens
2. **Claude/Gemini require user messages** - System-only prompts fail
3. **BAML doesn't support max_completion_tokens** - Limitation for o3 usage
4. **All BAML prompts updated** - Now use system + user roles

## Critical Findings

### 1. O3 Parameter Behavior - CONFIRMED ✅

**Test Results:**
- Setting `max_tokens=20` → Generated 99 tokens (completely ignored)
- Setting `max_completion_tokens=20` → Generated 0 tokens (respected)
- No error thrown when using max_tokens (silent failure)

**Impact:**
- O3 responses cannot be length-limited through BAML currently
- Must design prompts carefully to avoid excessive token usage
- Consider post-processing to truncate responses

### 2. Model Performance Rankings

| Model | Average Response Time | Consistency | Rank |
|-------|----------------------|-------------|------|
| gpt4o | 1.3s | Very High | 1 |
| gpt35turbo | 1.5s | High | 2 |
| gpto3 | 2.6s | Medium | 3 |
| claudeopus4 | 4.8s | Low | 4 |

### 3. Parameter Compatibility Matrix

| Model | max_tokens | max_completion_tokens | temperature | System-only msg |
|-------|------------|----------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| gpto3 | ❌ Ignored | ✅ Required | ❓ Unknown | ✅ Works |
| gpt4o | ✅ Works | ❌ Not used | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| claudeopus4 | ✅ Works | ❌ Not used | ✅ Works | ❌ Fails |
| gemini25pro | ✅ Works | ❌ Not used | ✅ Works | ❌ Fails |
| gpt35turbo | ✅ Works | ❌ Not used | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |

## Implementation Changes Made

### 1. BAML Prompt Updates
- All 8 BAML functions updated to use system + user roles
- Created TEMPLATE.baml for future functions
- Added validation tests for prompt structure

### 2. Documentation Updates
- Updated CLAUDE.md with BAML requirements
- Updated LLM abstraction spec (023-llm-abstraction.md)
- Created comprehensive testing plan
- Updated AI-assisted development workflow

### 3. BAML Configuration
```baml
// Updated ArgoGPTo3 client with warnings
client<llm> ArgoGPTo3 {
  provider openai
  options {
    model "gpto3"
    base_url "http://localhost:8000/v1"
    // WARNING: max_tokens is IGNORED by o3 models
    // O3 needs max_completion_tokens which BAML doesn't support
    max_tokens 4000  // This has NO EFFECT on o3
    timeout_seconds 60
  }
}
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **For O3 Usage**:
   - Design prompts to naturally limit response length
   - Implement post-processing to truncate if needed
   - Monitor token usage closely
   - Consider using gpt4o for length-sensitive tasks

2. **For Claude/Gemini**:
   - Always include user messages (already done)
   - Test thoroughly before production use
   - Monitor for API changes

### Future Improvements
1. **BAML Enhancement**:
   - Request max_completion_tokens support from BAML team
   - Consider custom OpenAI client wrapper if critical

2. **Model Selection Strategy**:
   - Use gpt4o as default (fast, reliable, standard params)
   - Use o3 for complex reasoning tasks (accept length limitation)
   - Use Claude for creative tasks (slower but capable)
   - Avoid Gemini until more testing done

## Test Scripts Created

1. `quick-model-test.py` - Confirms o3 max_tokens behavior
2. `focused-model-compatibility-test.py` - Comprehensive compatibility testing
3. `claude-system-only-test.py` - Isolates Claude message requirements
4. `test-claude-peng-fix.py` - Tests argo-proxy patches

## Known Limitations

1. **BAML doesn't support max_completion_tokens**
   - Cannot properly limit o3 response length
   - Workaround: Careful prompt design

2. **Argo-proxy using temporary fix branch**
   - Currently on fix/system_message branch
   - Update when official release available

3. **Model-specific quirks not fully abstracted**
   - Each model family has unique requirements
   - Abstraction layer helps but doesn't eliminate differences

## Conclusion

The comprehensive testing revealed critical model-specific requirements that were successfully addressed through BAML prompt updates and documentation. While some limitations remain (particularly o3 length control), the system is now properly configured to work with all target models.

The key learning: **True model agnosticism requires understanding and accommodating model-specific requirements, not ignoring them.**
