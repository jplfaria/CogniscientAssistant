# AI Co-Scientist Specification Plan

This document outlines the phased approach for creating CLEANROOM specifications for the AI Co-Scientist system. Each phase builds upon the previous ones, creating a comprehensive specification suite.

## Phase 1: System Foundation
- [x] 001-system-overview.md - High-level system behavior and goals
- [x] 002-core-principles.md - Expert-in-the-loop, safety, success criteria
- [x] 003-research-workflow.md - End-to-end process from input to output

## Phase 2: Multi-Agent Framework
- [x] 004-multi-agent-architecture.md - Agent collaboration patterns
- [x] 005-supervisor-agent.md - Orchestration and resource management
- [x] 006-task-queue-behavior.md - Asynchronous task execution patterns

## Phase 3: Core Research Agents
- [x] 007-generation-agent.md - Hypothesis creation behaviors
- [x] 008-reflection-agent.md - Review types and evaluation processes
- [x] 009-ranking-agent.md - Tournament system and Elo ratings
- [x] 010-evolution-agent.md - Hypothesis refinement strategies

## Phase 4: Supporting Agents
- [x] 011-proximity-agent.md - Similarity calculation and clustering
- [x] 012-meta-review-agent.md - Feedback synthesis and adaptation
- [ ] 013-agent-interaction-protocols.md - How agents communicate

## Phase 5: Tool and Resource Interfaces
- [ ] 014-web-search-interface.md - Literature and knowledge access
- [ ] 015-context-memory.md - System state persistence
- [ ] 016-external-tools.md - AlphaFold, other specialized models

## Phase 6: User Interaction
- [ ] 017-natural-language-interface.md - Research goal specification
- [ ] 018-expert-intervention-points.md - Where humans can guide the system
- [ ] 019-output-formats.md - NIH Specific Aims, research proposals

## Phase 7: Safety and Validation
- [ ] 020-safety-mechanisms.md - Goal review, hypothesis filtering
- [ ] 021-validation-criteria.md - Novelty, testability, alignment
- [ ] 022-monitoring-logging.md - System observability

## Phase 8: Extension and Integration
- [ ] 023-llm-abstraction.md - Model-agnostic design via BAML
- [ ] 024-argo-gateway-integration.md - Multi-model orchestration
- [ ] 025-deployment-patterns.md - Scaling and resource management

## Notes on Specification Development

Each specification should:
1. Focus on WHAT the system does, not HOW it's implemented
2. Define clear interfaces using BAML where appropriate
3. Include behavioral contracts and edge cases
4. Reference prerequisites from earlier phases
5. Use examples from the three validation cases (AML, liver fibrosis, AMR)

The specifications are CLEANROOM - they describe observable behaviors and interfaces without implementation details.

## Progress Tracking

Mark items with [x] when completed. Each spec should be committed individually with the message format:
```
spec: add [component] specification
```
