    "full_description": "Molecular perspective: Sirtuin histone deacetylases (especially SIRT1 and SIRT6) rely on fast proton tunneling events in their catalytic loops. Quantum-biology studies show that replacing ^1H with ^2H (deuterium) dramatically lowers tunneling probability (kinetic isotope effect). With age, intracellular deuterium content rises (dietary water, metabolic fractionation), slowing tunneling, decreasing sirtuin turnover, and promoting epigenetic drift.  \nSystems perspective: Reduced, asynchronous sirtuin activity propagates through chromatin as an emergent loss of coordinated nucleosome remodeling, generating age-associated DNA-methylation patterns that constitute the \u2018epigenetic clock\u2019. If proton-tunneling coherence can be globally resynchronized, cells could collectively revert to a younger epigenetic state.  \nComputational perspective: Multi-omic datasets reveal a non-linear inflection in both deuterium/protium ratios and sirtuin activity at ~50% of maximal lifespan in mammals. Agent-based simulations predict that boosting tunneling rate by \u226530% collapses the attractor corresponding to the aged methylome and steers the system toward a youthful attractor.  \nHypothesis: Ageing stems partly from progressive loss of quantum-coherent proton tunneling in sirtuin enzymes caused by deuterium enrichment and diminished vibrational coupling; supplying deuterium-depleted water (DDW) while applying phase-locked THz pulses that match sirtuin vibrational modes will re-establish coherence, enhance enzymatic turnover, re-synchronize chromatin remodeling, and reverse measurable aging markers.",

Concurrent application of amplitude-modulated RF fields tuned to the NV ground-state splitting (\u22482.87 GHz with \u00b1 few MHz detuning) further stabilizes entanglement.

    "full_description": "The hypothesis proposes that short-lived quantum\u2010coherent electron tunneling events occur between mitochondrial Complex I flavin mononucleotide (FMN) sites and proximate cytoskeletal microtubules. These events generate femtosecond spin-polarized redox waves that travel through the cytoskeleton to the nucleus, where they transiently modulate the quantum state of \u03c0-stacked DNA bases in CpG islands. In young cells, these waves maintain a low-methylation, high-acetylation chromatin landscape, promoting youthful gene expression. Aging disrupts coherence due to accumulated oxidative damage, altered NAD+/NADH ratios, and cytoskeletal stiffening. The hypothesis states that externally delivered, phase-locked picosecond THz pulse trains (0.8\u20132.5 THz) synchronized to mitochondrial respiratory oscillations can re-establish coherence, thereby resetting the epigenetic clock and reversing cellular aging markers.",

    "summary": "Influenza and other neuraminidase-positive respiratory infections can be diagnosed for < $1 by a paper strip containing egg-albumin (natural sialylated substrate), red-cabbage anthocyanin dye, and CaCO\u2083 buffer: viral neuraminidase in saliva liberates sialic acid, lowering local pH and shifting the dye from purple to pink within 15 min.",
    "full_description": "Many clinically important respiratory viruses (e.g., Influenza A/B, some avian and swine influenza variants) express neuraminidase that cleaves sialic acid residues from host glycoproteins. Salivary viral load is usually \u226510\u00b3\u201310\u2075 PFU ml\u207b\u00b9 during symptomatic infection, providing enzymatic activity detectable without amplification. Hen egg-white albumin is a plentiful, highly sialylated glycoprotein. When immobilised on cellulose together with a weak CaCO\u2083 buffer (pH 7.2) and a pH-sensitive anthocyanin dye extracted from red cabbage, liberation of sialic acid (pKa \u2248 2.6) by viral neuraminidase lowers the microenvironment pH to \u22646.0. This triggers a distinct colour change (purple \u2192 pink). The reaction is self-contained, uses only food-grade reagents, and needs no instrumentation: the user deposits 2\u20133 drops of saliva, waits 15 minutes, and visually reads the colour. The entire consumable costs ~US$0.07 at scale (paper 1 \u00a2, albumin 3 \u00a2, dye 2 \u00a2, binder/buffer 1 \u00a2). The hypothesis is that neuraminidase activity in saliva is sufficient to produce a visible pH shift under these conditions, enabling ultra-low-cost diagnosis of influenza-like illness.",
