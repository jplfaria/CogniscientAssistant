# Expert Intervention Points Specification

**Type**: System Feature  
**Interactions**: All Agents, Natural Language Interface, Context Memory

## Overview

The Expert Intervention Points define where and how human scientists can guide, refine, and collaborate with the AI Co-Scientist system. These intervention points implement the "scientist-in-the-loop" paradigm, ensuring human expertise remains central to the research process while leveraging AI capabilities for augmentation.

### Example 1: Research Goal Refinement

         8 will be excluded, 7 will be re-evaluated. Proceed?"
Scientist: "Yes, proceed"
System: "Research scope updated. Generation agent notified of new constraints."
```

### Example 2: Hypothesis Override
```
System: "Top ranked hypothesis: [Compound X for Target Y]"
Scientist: "Override - this target has known toxicity issues in humans"
System: "Noted. Hypothesis moved to rejected list with safety flag. 
         Would you like me to exclude all hypotheses targeting Y?"
Scientist: "Yes, and add a note about the specific toxicity"
System: "All Y-targeting hypotheses flagged. Safety note added to context."
```

### Example 3: Custom Hypothesis Submission
```
Scientist: "Add hypothesis: Combination of Drug A and Drug B for AML treatment"
System: "Hypothesis added to pool. Initial assessment:
         - Novelty: High (no prior combination studies found)
