## Examples

### Example 1: NIH Specific Aims for AML Drug Repurposing
```
Title: Repurposing KIRA6 as a Novel Therapeutic for Acute Myeloid Leukemia

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a devastating malignancy with 
5-year survival rates below 30%. Current therapies often fail due to 
resistance and severe toxicity. We propose repurposing KIRA6, an IRE1Î± 
inhibitor, as it showed exceptional efficacy (IC50=13nM) in AML cell 
lines through our AI-driven discovery platform.

OVERALL OBJECTIVE: To validate KIRA6 as a therapeutic agent for AML 
and elucidate its mechanism of action.

CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS: KIRA6 induces AML cell death by disrupting ER 
stress responses critical for leukemic cell survival.

Aim 1: Determine KIRA6's efficacy and mechanism in AML models.
We will test KIRA6 in patient-derived AML samples and xenograft models, 
using transcriptomics and proteomics to map its effects on ER stress 
pathways.

Aim 2: Identify biomarkers for KIRA6 sensitivity.
We will correlate KIRA6 response with genetic and molecular features 
across 50 AML samples to develop a precision medicine approach.

Aim 3: Optimize KIRA6 combination therapies.
We will screen KIRA6 with standard AML drugs to identify synergistic 
combinations that enhance efficacy while minimizing toxicity.

EXPECTED OUTCOMES: These studies will establish KIRA6's therapeutic 
potential and provide the foundation for clinical translation, 
potentially offering new hope for AML patients.

### Example 2: Research Overview Executive Summary
```
Research Goal: Identify novel epigenetic targets for liver fibrosis

KEY FINDINGS:
â¢ Discovered 17 high-confidence epigenetic targets with anti-fibrotic potential
â¢ Top candidate: BRD4 inhibition (Elo: 1456) reverses stellate cell activation
â¢ Identified 4 synergistic target combinations for enhanced efficacy
â¢ Validated approach using patient-derived hepatic organoids
â¢ Novel mechanism: HDAC6-TGFÎ² feedback loop disruption

RECOMMENDED PRIORITIES:
1. Advance BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 analog testing in 3D liver models
2. Investigate HDAC6/BET dual inhibition strategy  
3. Develop stellate cell-specific delivery methods
4. Initiate combination screening with standard of care
5. Establish biomarker panel for treatment response
```

### Example 3: Experimental Protocol Summary
```
Protocol: BRD4 Inhibition in Hepatic Stellate Cells
Reference: Hypothesis LF-2024-0089
Version: 1.2

OBJECTIVES:
Primary: Assess JQ1 impact on stellate cell activation markers
Secondary: Determine dose-response and reversibility

KEY METHODS:
1. Isolate primary stellate cells from fibrotic liver tissue
2. Culture in activation medium Â± JQ1 (0.1-10 Î¼M)
3. Measure: Î±SMA, Col1a1, TIMP1 expression (qPCR, Western)
4. Assess: Cell viability, proliferation, migration
5. Timeline: 7-day treatment with daily medium changes

CRITICAL CONTROLS:
- Vehicle (DMSO) negative control
- TGFÎ² activation positive control  
- Hepatocyte co-culture for specificity
- Time-matched untreated samples

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- >50% reduction in activation markers at non-toxic doses
- Dose-dependent response with clear IC50
- Reversibility upon treatment withdrawal
- Minimal hepatocyte toxicity (<10%)
