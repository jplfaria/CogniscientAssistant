# Resource Boundaries and Overflow Behaviors Specification

**Type**: System-wide Behaviors  
**Status**: Core Specification

## Prerequisites
- Read: 005-supervisor-agent.md (resource management)
- Read: 006-task-queue-behavior.md (queue limits)
- Read: 015-context-memory.md (storage management)
- Read: 025-deployment-patterns.md (scaling limits)

## Purpose

This specification defines system behavior at resource boundaries, overflow handling strategies, and graceful degradation patterns. These behaviors ensure the system remains stable and predictable under load, preventing crashes and data loss.

## System Resource Limits

### Memory Boundaries

```yaml
memory_limits:
  context_memory_per_session:
    limit: "10 GB"
    warning_threshold: "8 GB (80%)"
    critical_threshold: "9.5 GB (95%)"
    
  hypothesis_storage:
    max_per_session: 1000
    warning_threshold: 800
    critical_threshold: 950
    
  agent_working_memory:
    per_agent_limit: "2 GB"
    shared_pool: "10 GB"
    
  system_total:
    limit: "100 GB"
    reserved_for_os: "10 GB"
```

### Computational Boundaries

```yaml
compute_limits:
  concurrent_research_sessions:
    maximum: 10
    warning_threshold: 8
    queue_additional: true
    
  worker_processes:
    minimum: 5
    maximum: 50
    default: 10
    scaling_increment: 5
    
  concurrent_agent_instances:
    generation: 5
    reflection: 10
    ranking: 5
    evolution: 3
    proximity: 2
    meta_review: 1
```

### Queue Boundaries

```yaml
queue_limits:
  task_queue:
    maximum_size: 10000
    warning_threshold: 8000
    critical_threshold: 9500
    
  priority_buckets:
    urgent: 1000
    high: 3000
    normal: 5000
    low: 1000
    
  per_session_limit: 1000
  message_size_limit: "10 MB"
```

## Overflow Behaviors

### Memory Overflow Handling

When memory limits are reached:

```yaml
memory_overflow_actions:
  at_warning_threshold:
    - action: "Log warning with memory statistics"
    - action: "Trigger proactive cleanup"
    - action: "Notify supervisor for resource reallocation"
    
  at_critical_threshold:
    - action: "Pause new hypothesis generation"
    - action: "Archive 20% oldest hypotheses to disk"
    - action: "Compress context memory history"
    - action: "Force garbage collection"
    
  at_limit:
    - action: "Reject new research sessions"
    - action: "Emergency archive 50% of data"
    - action: "Terminate lowest-priority sessions with notice"
    - action: "Enter read-only mode for existing sessions"
```

### Queue Overflow Handling

When task queues reach capacity:

```yaml
queue_overflow_actions:
  at_warning_threshold:
    - action: "Log queue statistics"
    - action: "Increase worker pool if possible"
    - action: "Alert about potential backlog"
    
  at_critical_threshold:
    - action: "Reject low-priority tasks"
    - action: "Increase processing parallelism"
    - action: "Defer non-essential operations"
    
  at_limit:
    - action: "Reject new tasks with error"
    - action: "Return 'QUEUE_FULL' status"
    - action: "Suggest retry with exponential backoff"
    - action: "Preserve in-flight task integrity"
```

### Worker Pool Exhaustion

When no workers are available:

```yaml
worker_exhaustion_actions:
  immediate_response:
    - action: "Queue task with timestamp"
    - action: "Return 'QUEUED' status to caller"
    
  wait_behavior:
    - timeout: "30 seconds"
    - retry_count: 3
    - backoff: "exponential: 1s, 5s, 25s"
    
  if_timeout:
    - action: "Return 'NO_WORKERS_AVAILABLE' error"
    - action: "Suggest reduced scope or retry later"
    - action: "Log resource contention event"
```

## Graceful Degradation Strategies

### Feature Degradation Priority

When resources are constrained, disable features in this order:

```yaml
degradation_sequence:
  1_disable_first:
    - "Evolution cycles for low-ranked hypotheses"
    - "Deep verification reviews"
    - "Multi-turn tournament debates"
    
  2_reduce_next:
    - "Hypothesis generation batch size (20 → 10 → 5)"
    - "Tournament comparison depth"
    - "Context memory detail level"
    
  3_minimize_then:
    - "Parallel processing (serialize operations)"
    - "Review types (only safety + initial)"
    - "Web search depth"
    
  4_essential_only:
    - "Basic generation + safety review only"
    - "No evolution or tournaments"
    - "Minimal context preservation"
```

### Quality vs Performance Tradeoffs

```yaml
adaptive_quality:
  normal_resources:
    generation_batch: 20
    review_types: "all"
    tournament_rounds: "full"
    
  constrained_resources:
    generation_batch: 10
    review_types: "safety,initial,full"
    tournament_rounds: "limited"
    
  minimal_resources:
    generation_batch: 5
    review_types: "safety,initial"
    tournament_rounds: "none"
```

## Resource Allocation Priorities

### Session Priority Scoring

```yaml
session_priority:
  factors:
    age: "Older sessions get +10 priority per hour"
    progress: "Near-complete sessions get +50 priority"
    user_tier: "Premium users get +100 priority"
    safety_critical: "Safety-related research +200 priority"
    
  resource_allocation:
    top_20_percent: "60% of resources"
    middle_60_percent: "35% of resources"
    bottom_20_percent: "5% of resources"
```

### Agent Priority Matrix

```yaml
agent_priorities:
  critical_path:
    supervisor: "HIGHEST - always runs"
    safety_review: "HIGHEST - never skipped"
    
  high_priority:
    generation: "HIGH - core functionality"
    initial_review: "HIGH - quality gate"
    
  medium_priority:
    ranking: "MEDIUM - can be deferred"
    full_review: "MEDIUM - can be batched"
    
  low_priority:
    evolution: "LOW - enhancement only"
    proximity: "LOW - optimization only"
    meta_review: "LOW - can skip iterations"
```

## Boundary Condition Behaviors

### Hypothesis Count Boundaries

```yaml
hypothesis_limits:
  at_80_percent_capacity:
    - "Increase evolution threshold (top 10% only)"
    - "Prune bottom 20% by Elo"
    
  at_100_percent_capacity:
    - "Stop accepting new hypotheses"
    - "Force pruning of bottom 30%"
    - "Archive pruned hypotheses for potential recovery"
```

### Iteration Limit Boundaries

```yaml
iteration_limits:
  approaching_limit:
    at_80_percent: "Notify user of approaching limit"
    at_90_percent: "Accelerate convergence checks"
    at_95_percent: "Begin result compilation"
    
  at_limit:
    - "Complete current iteration"
    - "Skip evolution cycle"
    - "Generate final report"
    - "Graceful termination"
```

## Resource Monitoring and Alerts

### Monitoring Requirements

```yaml
resource_monitoring:
  sampling_frequency: "Every 10 seconds"
  
  metrics_tracked:
    - "Memory usage per component"
    - "Queue depths and growth rate"
    - "Worker utilization percentage"
    - "Task completion rate"
    - "Resource contention events"
    
  alert_thresholds:
    - "Any resource >80% for 5 minutes"
    - "Queue growth >100 tasks/minute"
    - "Worker starvation >30 seconds"
    - "Memory growth >1GB/hour"
```

### Predictive Scaling

```yaml
predictive_behaviors:
  trend_detection:
    - "Monitor resource usage trends"
    - "Predict exhaustion time"
    - "Pre-emptive scaling at 70% if trend continues"
    
  seasonal_patterns:
    - "Learn usage patterns over time"
    - "Pre-allocate resources for predicted peaks"
    - "Scale down during predicted quiet periods"
```

## Recovery After Resource Exhaustion

### Post-Overflow Recovery

```yaml
recovery_procedures:
  memory_recovery:
    - "Verify data integrity after emergency archive"
    - "Gradually restore archived data as space allows"
    - "Rebalance load across sessions"
    
  queue_recovery:
    - "Process backlog in priority order"
    - "Merge duplicate requests"
    - "Notify users of processing delays"
    
  worker_recovery:
    - "Health check all workers"
    - "Replace failed workers"
    - "Redistribute incomplete tasks"
```

## Resource Boundary Configuration

All limits MUST be configurable:

```yaml
configuration:
  static_limits: "Defined in deployment config"
  dynamic_limits: "Adjustable via supervisor API"
  auto_scaling: "Based on available system resources"
  override_capability: "Admin can temporarily exceed limits"
```

## Observable Behaviors

Systems MUST expose resource state:
- Real-time resource utilization dashboards
- Historical resource usage trends  
- Overflow event logs with full context
- Recovery action audit trail
- Performance impact measurements
