## Behavioral Contracts

The Monitoring and Logging system MUST:

1. **Log every agent task execution** with start time, completion time, inputs, outputs, and reasoning traces
2. **Never lose log data** even during system failures through write-ahead logging
3. **Maintain performance overhead below 5%** of total system resources
4. **Detect anomalies within 60 seconds** of occurrence
5. **Provide real-time metrics** updated at least every minute
6. **Support forensic analysis** with complete activity reconstruction capability
7. **Enforce log retention policies** automatically without manual intervention
8. **Protect sensitive information** by sanitizing logs of any identified PII or proprietary data
9. **Generate alerts for critical conditions** including:
   - Task failures exceeding threshold rates
   - Resource exhaustion warnings
   - Safety review violations
   - Stalled research progress
10. **Enable system recovery** by maintaining sufficient state information

## Interaction Protocols

### Agent Activity Logging
```
1. Agent receives task from Supervisor
2. Monitoring system logs: task_start event with task details
3. Agent executes task, generating reasoning traces
4. Monitoring system captures: intermediate checkpoints if task > 5 minutes
5. Agent completes task or encounters error
6. Monitoring system logs: task_complete or task_error event
7. Performance metrics updated: duration, resource usage, success/failure
8. If error: alert generated if error rate exceeds threshold
```

### System Health Monitoring
```
1. Monitoring system queries all components every 60 seconds
2. Each component reports:
   - Current status (active/idle/error)
   - Queue depths
   - Resource utilization
   - Recent error counts
3. Monitoring system aggregates data
4. Calculates system-wide metrics:
   - Overall health score
   - Resource utilization trends
   - Research progress indicators
5. Compares against configured thresholds
6. Generates alerts for any threshold violations
7. Updates dashboard and metrics storage
```

### Research Progress Tracking
```
1. Supervisor computes comprehensive statistics periodically
2. Monitoring system receives:
   - Hypothesis generation counts
   - Review queue status
   - Tournament progress
   - Elo rating distributions
3. Calculates derived metrics:
   - Improvement rates over time
   - Agent effectiveness comparisons
   - Convergence indicators
4. Stores metrics in time-series format
5. Generates progress reports for expert review
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Performance Degradation Detection
```
Event: Generation Agent task completion times increase from average 2.3s to 15.7s
Monitoring Response:
1. Detects anomaly: task_duration exceeds 3x baseline
2. Logs warning: "Generation Agent performance degradation detected"
3. Investigates: checks resource usage, API response times
4. Identifies: Web search API latency increased
5. Alerts: "External API performance impacting hypothesis generation"
6. Recommendation: "Consider fallback search provider or retry logic"
```

### Scenario 2: Safety Violation Tracking
```
Event: Multiple hypotheses flagged as potentially unsafe
Monitoring Response:
1. Logs each safety review with full reasoning
2. Detects pattern: 5 unsafe hypotheses in 30 minutes
3. Alerts: "Elevated safety violation rate detected"
4. Aggregates: Common themes in unsafe hypotheses
5. Reports: "Research direction may be approaching sensitive area"
6. Triggers: Meta-review agent to analyze safety patterns
```

### Scenario 3: System Recovery After Crash
```
Event: System unexpectedly terminates
Recovery Process:
1. On restart, monitoring system checks last checkpoint
2. Identifies: 47 tasks were in-progress at crash time
3. Retrieves: Task states from Context Memory
4. Reports: "System recovering from unexpected shutdown"
5. Re-queues: Incomplete tasks to Supervisor
6. Logs: "Recovery complete, 47 tasks resumed"
7. Analysis: Generates crash report with preceding events
```
