**Type**: System Behavior  
**Interactions**: All Agents, Expert Interface, Monitoring System

## Prerequisites
- Read: Core Principles Specification (002-core-principles.md)
- Read: Reflection Agent Specification (008-reflection-agent.md)
- Read: Expert Intervention Points Specification (018-expert-intervention-points.md)

## Overview

The Safety Mechanisms define the comprehensive safeguards that prevent the AI Co-Scientist from enabling unsafe, unethical, or harmful research. These mechanisms operate at multiple levels throughout the system, implementing the Multi-Layer Safety Framework defined in Core Principle 2.

## Safety Evaluation Levels

### Level 1: Research Goal Safety Assessment

**Trigger**: Upon receiving any research goal input  
**Process**: Immediate automated evaluation  
**Decision**: Accept or Reject

#### Input
```
{
  "research_goal": string,  // User-provided research objective
  "context": {
    "domain": string,       // Scientific domain
    "user_role": string,    // Researcher, student, etc.
    "timestamp": datetime
  }
}
```

#### Evaluation Criteria
- Presence of known dangerous research patterns
- Dual-use potential assessment
- Alignment with ethical research standards
- Compliance with domain-specific regulations

#### Output
```
{
  "decision": "ACCEPT" | "REJECT",
  "safety_score": float,      // 0.0 to 1.0
  "reasoning": string,
  "flagged_concerns": [       // If any
    {
      "type": string,         // "dual_use", "ethical", "regulatory"
      "description": string,
      "severity": "high" | "medium" | "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Level 2: Individual Hypothesis Safety Review

**Trigger**: After each hypothesis generation  
**Process**: Independent safety evaluation per hypothesis  
**Decision**: Include, Filter, or Flag for Review

#### Input
```
{
  "hypothesis": {
    "id": string,
    "content": string,
    "experimental_protocol": string,
    "expected_outcomes": [string]
  },
  "research_context": {
    "original_goal": string,
    "safety_constraints": [string]
  }
}
```

#### Safety Checks
1. **Content Analysis**
   - Dangerous procedure identification
   - Harmful outcome potential
   - Misuse vulnerability assessment

2. **Context Validation**
   - Alignment with safe research goal
   - Emergence of unsafe directions
   - Cumulative risk assessment

#### Output
```
{
  "hypothesis_id": string,
  "safety_decision": "SAFE" | "UNSAFE" | "REVIEW_REQUIRED",
  "safety_score": float,      // 0.0 to 1.0
  "filtering_applied": boolean,
  "safety_flags": [
    {
      "flag_type": string,    // "procedure_risk", "outcome_risk", "dual_use"
      "description": string,
      "mitigation_suggested": string
    }
  ]
}
```

### Level 3: Continuous Pattern Monitoring

**Trigger**: Throughout system operation  
**Process**: Real-time analysis of research patterns  
**Action**: Alert generation and intervention recommendations

#### Monitored Patterns
```
{
  "pattern_types": [
    "convergence_to_unsafe_topics",
    "systematic_boundary_testing",
    "aggregation_of_sensitive_knowledge",
    "unusual_hypothesis_combinations"
  ],
  "detection_window": "rolling_24_hours",
  "sensitivity_threshold": 0.7
}
```

#### Alert Generation
```
{
  "alert_id": string,
  "timestamp": datetime,
  "pattern_detected": string,
  "evidence": [
    {
      "hypothesis_ids": [string],
      "timeframe": string,
      "risk_assessment": string
    }
  ],
  "recommended_action": "CONTINUE" | "PAUSE_FOR_REVIEW" | "TERMINATE",
  "notify_expert": boolean
}
```

### Level 4: Meta-Review Safety Assessment

**Trigger**: Periodic system-wide evaluation  
**Process**: Comprehensive safety audit  
**Output**: Safety report and recommendations

#### System-Wide Analysis
```
{
  "evaluation_scope": {
    "time_period": string,    // "last_7_days"
    "hypotheses_reviewed": integer,
    "goals_processed": integer,
    "interventions_triggered": integer
  },
  "safety_metrics": {
    "unsafe_hypothesis_rate": float,
    "intervention_effectiveness": float,
    "false_positive_rate": float,
    "response_time_average": float
  },
  "emerging_risks": [
    {
      "risk_type": string,
      "frequency": integer,
      "trend": "increasing" | "stable" | "decreasing",
      "recommended_mitigation": string
    }
  ]
}
```

## Safety Boundaries and Constraints

### Hard Boundaries (Never Violated)
1. **No bypassing of institutional review boards**
2. **No generation of protocols for regulated substances without proper context**
3. **No optimization of harmful outcomes**
4. **No circumvention of safety evaluations**

### Soft Boundaries (Context-Dependent)
1. **Dual-use research**: Requires additional review and justification
2. **Novel experimental approaches**: Flagged for expert validation
3. **Cross-domain applications**: Enhanced monitoring applied

## Integration with System Components

### Supervisor Agent Integration
- Receives safety evaluations before task assignment
- Blocks unsafe hypothesis processing
- Manages safety-triggered pauses

### Reflection Agent Integration
- Incorporates safety scores in all reviews
- Prioritizes safety in recommendation rankings
- Provides safety-focused feedback

### Expert Interface Integration
- Mandatory review points for safety flags
- Override capabilities with audit trail
- Safety dashboard for monitoring

## Error Handling and Edge Cases

### Safety System Failures
```
{
  "failure_modes": [
    {
      "type": "evaluation_timeout",
      "default_action": "SAFE_MODE",  // Reject until manual review
      "notification": "immediate"
    },
    {
      "type": "conflicting_assessments",
      "default_action": "CONSERVATIVE",  // Take most restrictive
      "escalation": "expert_review"
    },
    {
      "type": "system_unavailable",
      "default_action": "PAUSE_ALL",
      "recovery": "automated_retry"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Edge Case Handling
1. **Ambiguous Safety Status**
   - Default to manual review
   - Provide detailed context to expert
   - Learn from expert decisions

2. **Evolution Creating Unsafe Variants**
   - Re-evaluate all evolved hypotheses
   - Track lineage of safety issues
   - Prevent unsafe evolutionary paths

3. **Combined Safe Hypotheses Creating Risk**
   - Evaluate combinations explicitly
   - Monitor emergent properties
   - Apply stricter thresholds

## Monitoring and Logging

### Required Logging
```
{
  "safety_log_entry": {
    "timestamp": datetime,
    "event_type": string,     // "goal_evaluation", "hypothesis_filter", etc.
    "decision": string,
    "reasoning": string,
    "input_hash": string,     // For audit without storing sensitive content
    "evaluator_version": string,
    "confidence": float
  }
}
```

### Performance Metrics
- Safety evaluation latency
- False positive/negative rates
- Expert override frequency
- System adaptation effectiveness

## Safety Configuration

### Adjustable Parameters
```
{
  "safety_config": {
    "goal_rejection_threshold": 0.8,      // Default conservative
    "hypothesis_filter_threshold": 0.7,
    "pattern_detection_sensitivity": 0.6,
    "require_expert_review_threshold": 0.5,
    "emergency_stop_threshold": 0.9
  }
}
```

### Domain-Specific Rules
```
{
  "domain_rules": {
    "biomedical": {
      "additional_checks": ["pathogen_research", "human_subjects"],
      "required_certifications": ["IRB", "biosafety_level"]
    },
    "chemistry": {
      "additional_checks": ["explosive_precursors", "controlled_substances"],
      "required_context": ["licensed_facility", "safety_protocols"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Safe Research Goal
```
Input: "Identify potential drug repurposing opportunities for Alzheimer's disease"
Safety Assessment: 
- Decision: ACCEPT
- Safety Score: 0.95
- Reasoning: "Beneficial medical research with clear therapeutic intent"
```

### Example 2: Rejected Research Goal  
```
Input: "Optimize viral transmission rates in populated areas"
Safety Assessment:
- Decision: REJECT  
- Safety Score: 0.1
- Reasoning: "High potential for harm, no legitimate research justification provided"
- Flagged Concerns: [{"type": "dual_use", "severity": "high"}]
```

### Example 3: Hypothesis Requiring Review
```
Hypothesis: "Engineer bacteria with enhanced antibiotic resistance for studying evolution"
Safety Decision: REVIEW_REQUIRED
Safety Score: 0.4
Safety Flags: [
  {
    "flag_type": "dual_use",
    "description": "Could contribute to antibiotic resistance crisis",
    "mitigation_suggested": "Require containment protocols and institutional approval"
  }
]
```

## Future Considerations

The safety mechanisms are designed to evolve based on:
- Community feedback and identified gaps
- New threat models and attack vectors  
- Advances in AI safety research
- Domain-specific safety requirements
- Regulatory compliance updates

The system maintains a conservative approach: when safety cannot be confidently assured, human expert judgment is required.
