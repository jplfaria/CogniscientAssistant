## Overview

The Deployment Patterns specification defines how the AI Co-Scientist system scales and manages resources in production environments. It specifies the behaviors for distributing work across computational resources, handling failures, and optimizing performance through dynamic resource allocation.

## Core Behaviors

### 1. Worker Pool Management

The system MUST maintain a pool of worker processes that:
- Execute agent tasks asynchronously
- Scale horizontally based on computational demand
- Operate independently without blocking each other
- Report status and progress to the Supervisor Agent
- Handle failures gracefully with automatic recovery

### 2. Resource Allocation

The system MUST allocate computational resources:
- Dynamically based on task queue depth
- According to agent effectiveness metrics
- With configurable minimum and maximum bounds
- Through continuous monitoring and adjustment
- With priority given to bottleneck agents

### 3. Scaling Patterns

The system MUST support two scaling dimensions:
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more worker processes
- **Vertical Scaling**: Allocating more compute time per task

## Behavioral Contracts

### Worker Process Management

The system MUST:
- Maintain at least `min_workers` processes at all times
- Not exceed `max_workers` even under high load
- Replace failed workers within 30 seconds
- Distribute tasks evenly across available workers
- Prevent task starvation through fair scheduling

The system MUST NOT:
- Allow workers to claim multiple tasks simultaneously
- Lose tasks when workers fail
- Scale beyond resource limits
- Create workers without proper health checks

### Resource Optimization

The system MUST:
- Monitor agent effectiveness continuously
- Adjust agent weights based on performance data
- Allocate more resources to high-performing agents
- Reduce resources for underperforming agents
- Maintain minimum resources for all agent types

The system MUST NOT:
- Completely disable any agent type
- Make drastic weight adjustments (>50% change at once)
- Ignore resource limit constraints
- Optimize for speed over quality

### Test-Time Compute Scaling

The system MUST:
- Increase iterations when quality improvements are detected
- Stop iterations when improvements plateau
- Track cumulative compute time per research goal
- Balance exploration vs exploitation
- Report iteration effectiveness metrics

The system MUST NOT:
- Exceed maximum iteration limits
- Continue iterations without measurable improvement
- Ignore user-specified time constraints

## Interaction Protocols

### With Supervisor Agent

The deployment system:
- Receives task assignment requests
- Reports worker availability
- Provides scaling recommendations
- Accepts weight adjustment commands
- Shares system health metrics

### With Worker Processes

The deployment system:
- Assigns agents to workers
- Monitors worker health
- Handles worker lifecycle (start/stop/restart)
- Collects performance metrics
- Manages work distribution

### With Context Memory

The deployment system:
- Reads agent performance history
- Stores scaling decisions
- Retrieves system state for recovery
- Updates resource utilization logs

## Error Handling

### Worker Failures
- Automatic restart within 30 seconds
- Task reassignment to healthy workers
- State recovery from Context Memory
- Escalation to reduced capacity mode if needed

### Resource Exhaustion
- Gradual degradation rather than complete failure
- Priority-based task scheduling
- Temporary suspension of non-critical agents
- Alert generation for operator intervention

### API Rate Limiting
- Exponential backoff with jitter
- Request distribution across time windows
- Fallback to cached results when available
- Graceful quality degradation

## Examples

### Example 1: Scale-Up Scenario
```
Input: Queue depth increases to 500 generation tasks
Metrics: Current workers: 10, CPU utilization: 85%

Output: Scale up to 20 workers
Decision: Detected high queue depth for generation tasks.
Action: Starting 10 additional workers with generation agent assignment.
```

### Example 2: Agent Weight Adjustment
```
Input: Reflection agent completing tasks 3x faster than others
Metrics: Reflection agent effectiveness score: 0.95

Output: Increase reflection agent weight from 0.15 to 0.25
Decision: High-performing agent identified.
Action: Reallocating resources to maximize system throughput.
```

### Example 3: Test-Time Compute Scaling
```
Input: Hypothesis quality improving with iterations
Metrics: Elo increase per iteration: 0.05

Output: Continue iterations up to maximum
Decision: Significant quality improvements detected.
Action: Extending compute time for current research goal.
```
