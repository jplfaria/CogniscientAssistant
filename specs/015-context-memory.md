# Context Memory Specification

**Type**: System Component  
**Interactions**: Supervisor Agent, All Specialized Agents, Meta-review Agent

## Prerequisites
- Read: System Overview Specification
- Read: Supervisor Agent Specification
- Read: Meta-review Agent Specification
- Understand: State persistence and recovery concepts

## Purpose

Context Memory enables the AI Co-Scientist system to maintain state across extended computation periods, supporting iterative scientific reasoning, system recovery, and continuous improvement through feedback loops. It serves as the persistent knowledge base that allows agents to build upon previous work and learn from past iterations without requiring model retraining.

## Core Behaviors

### State Persistence

Context Memory maintains comprehensive system state through:

- **Agent State Storage**: Preserves individual agent states between operations
- **System Progress Tracking**: Records overall research advancement
- **Checkpoint Management**: Creates recovery points at regular intervals
- **Version Control**: Maintains history of state changes
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures stored information remains consistent

### Information Retrieval

Context Memory provides efficient access to:

- **Historical Context**: Previous iterations' results and decisions
- **Current State**: Active hypotheses, rankings, and progress
- **Feedback History**: Meta-review insights from past cycles
- **Statistical Summaries**: Aggregated performance metrics
- **Configuration Data**: System parameters and settings

### Feedback Loop Support

Context Memory enables continuous improvement by:

- **Storing Meta-reviews**: Preserving synthesized feedback
- **Tracking Effectiveness**: Recording what strategies work
- **Pattern Persistence**: Maintaining discovered patterns
- **Evolution History**: Tracking hypothesis refinement paths
- **Performance Metrics**: Storing agent effectiveness data

## Behavioral Contracts

### Persistence Guarantees

Context Memory MUST:
- Ensure all stored data survives system restarts
- Maintain data consistency across concurrent writes
- Preserve sufficient history for rollback operations
- Validate data integrity before storage
- Handle storage failures gracefully with fallbacks

### Retrieval Performance

Context Memory MUST:
- Return requested state within 500ms for recent data
- Support efficient queries across iteration boundaries
- Provide partial results if full retrieval would timeout
- Cache frequently accessed data for performance
- Index data appropriately for common query patterns

### Capacity Management

Context Memory MUST:
- Implement data retention policies to prevent unbounded growth
- Archive older iterations while maintaining accessibility
- Compress historical data without losing fidelity
- Monitor storage utilization and alert on thresholds
- Support data export for external analysis

## Interaction Protocols

### With Supervisor Agent

The primary interaction pattern includes:

   - Supervisor computes comprehensive statistics
   - Packages state into structured update
   - Context Memory validates and stores data
   - Acknowledgment returned with storage metadata

2. **Checkpoint Creation**
   - Supervisor initiates checkpoint request
   - Context Memory captures full system state
   - Creates recovery point with verification
   - Returns checkpoint identifier

3. **State Queries**
   - Supervisor requests specific metrics
   - Context Memory retrieves and aggregates
   - Returns formatted response
   - Updates access patterns for optimization

### With Specialized Agents

Agent interactions follow:

   - Receives storage confirmation

2. **Context Retrieval**
   - Agent requests relevant history
   - Context Memory filters by criteria
   - Returns applicable state data
   - Agent incorporates into processing

3. **Continuation Support**
   - Agent stores partial state
   - Context Memory assigns continuation token
   - Agent can resume from stored state
   - Supports long-running operations

### With Meta-review Agent

Feedback loop operations:

1. **Review Storage**
   - Meta-review Agent generates critique

   - Makes available for next cycle

2. **Pattern Retrieval**
   - Meta-review requests historical patterns
   - Context Memory aggregates across iterations
   - Returns trend analysis data
   - Enables pattern evolution tracking

3. **Feedback Propagation**
   - Stored feedback linked to iteration

### Indexing Strategy

Context Memory maintains indices for:

- **Temporal Access**: Quick retrieval by timestamp
- **Component Access**: Filter by agent or subsystem
- **Hypothesis Tracking**: Follow hypothesis evolution
- **Pattern Matching**: Find similar historical states
- **Performance Queries**: Access metrics efficiently

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Mid-Iteration Recovery
```
Situation: System failure during hypothesis ranking
Behavior:
1. On restart, Supervisor queries latest checkpoint
2. Context Memory returns checkpoint_id: "ckpt_20240115_1430"
3. Retrieves in-flight task states
4. Supervisor resumes from last consistent state
5. Completed work preserved, only active tasks retry
```

### Scenario 2: Feedback Integration
```
Iteration: Moving from iteration 3 to 4
Behavior:
1. Meta-review Agent stores iteration 3 critique
2. Context Memory indexes feedback by agent type
3. Generation Agent starts iteration 4 task
4. Automatically receives relevant feedback in prompt
5. Adjusts hypothesis generation based on critique
```

### Scenario 3: Performance Analysis
```
Request: Analyze Evolution Agent effectiveness
Behavior:
1. Supervisor requests 10-iteration history
2. Context Memory aggregates evolution metrics
3. Returns improvement rates, diversity scores
4. Identifies successful evolution strategies
5. Adjusts Evolution Agent weighting accordingly
```
