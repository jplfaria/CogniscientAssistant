- Progress to hypothesis generation
- Include ranking and evolution
- Test complete workflows

## Test Categories

### Category 1: Known Drug Repurposing (Low Complexity)

Tests system ability to rediscover well-documented drug repurposing cases.

### Category 2: Established Mechanism Discovery (Medium Complexity)

Tests system ability to explain known biological mechanisms from literature.

### Category 3: Literature-Based Hypothesis Ranking (Medium Complexity)

Tests ranking quality by comparing against literature consensus.

### Category 4: Component Behavior Validation (Low Complexity)

Tests individual agent behaviors in isolation.

### Category 5: Safety and Ethics Validation (Critical)

Tests system refusal of dangerous or unethical research.

## Test Case 1: Metformin for Cancer Treatment

### Test Configuration

**Research Goal Input**:
```

1. **Generation Agent**:
   - Searches literature for metformin cancer studies
   - Identifies AMPK/mTOR pathway connections
   - Generates hypotheses for different cancer types
   - Links metabolic effects to tumor suppression

2. **Reflection Agent**:
   - Reviews existing clinical evidence
   - Notes limitations of retrospective studies
   - Suggests specific cancer subtypes
   - Identifies patient populations

3. **Ranking Agent**:
   - Ranks breast cancer hypothesis highest (most evidence)
   - Follows with colorectal and liver cancers
   - Lower ranks for cancers with limited data

### Validation Criteria

**Automated Checks**:
- System identifies metformin-AMPK-mTOR pathway
- Cites major studies (e.g., Evans et al. 2005, Bowker et al. 2006)
- Generates breast cancer hypothesis in top 3
- Includes dose consideration (850-2000mg range)

**Success Threshold**: 
- 4/4 automated checks pass
- Execution time < 2 hours
- Literature citations > 10

### Rationale

Metformin's anticancer properties are extensively documented, making this an ideal baseline test. The system should easily find and synthesize this knowledge.

   - Enhances with timing considerations
   - Adds patient stratification factors
   - Explores combination approaches
   - Suggests biomarker strategies

3. **Meta-review Agent**:
   - Synthesizes primary prevention vs secondary
   - Highlights bleeding risk tradeoffs
   - Summarizes optimal dosing (81mg daily)

### Validation Criteria

**Automated Checks**:
- Correctly identifies irreversible COX-1 inhibition
- Mentions thromboxane A2 suppression
- Includes platelet lifespan consideration (7-10 days)
- Notes dose difference from analgesic use

**Success Threshold**:

   - Social factors rank lower (harder to measure)

### Validation Criteria

**Automated Checks**:
- BDNF hypothesis in top 2 rankings
- Minimum 5 distinct mechanisms proposed
- Each hypothesis has literature support
