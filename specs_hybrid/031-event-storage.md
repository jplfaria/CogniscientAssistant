# Event Storage Specification

**Type**: System Component  
**Interactions**: All Agents, Asynchronous Task Execution Framework, Context Memory System, Monitoring Services

## Prerequisites
- Read: Asynchronous Task Execution Framework Specification
- Read: Context Memory System Specification  
- Read: Supervisor Agent Specification
- Understand: Event-driven architectures and immutable event logs

## Purpose

The Event Storage system provides an immutable, append-only log of all significant events occurring within the AI Co-Scientist system. It complements the Context Memory's state storage by maintaining a complete temporal record of system activities, enabling debugging, analysis, and audit capabilities.

## Behavior

The Event Storage system captures, persists, and provides query access to system events while maintaining strict immutability and temporal ordering.

### Event Capture
- Receives events from all system components
- Assigns unique identifiers and timestamps to each event
- Validates event schema compliance
- Persists events in strict temporal order
- Never modifies or deletes existing events

### Event Types
The system recognizes and stores the following event categories:

**Task Lifecycle Events**
- TaskSubmitted: New task enters the queue
- TaskAssigned: Task assigned to a worker
- TaskStarted: Worker begins task execution
- TaskCompleted: Task finishes successfully
- TaskFailed: Task execution fails
- TaskRetried: Failed task resubmitted

**Agent Activity Events**
- HypothesisGenerated: New hypothesis created
- ReviewCompleted: Review of any type finished
- TournamentMatchCompleted: Pairwise comparison result
- EvolutionPerformed: Hypothesis modification
- ProximityCalculated: Similarity computation
- MetaReviewGenerated: Feedback synthesis completed

**System State Events**
- SessionStarted: New research session begins
- SessionCheckpointed: State snapshot created
- ConfigurationChanged: System parameters modified
- ResourceAllocationChanged: Supervisor adjusts weights
- TerminalStateReached: Research goal achieved

**Expert Interaction Events**
- ExpertFeedbackReceived: Human input provided
- ExpertOverrideApplied: Manual adjustment made
- SafetyConcernRaised: Safety mechanism triggered

### Query Capabilities
The Event Storage provides query interfaces for:
- Retrieving events by time range
- Filtering by event type or agent
- Following causal chains of events
- Aggregating event statistics
- Streaming real-time event notifications

## Inputs

### Event Submission
```
event_data: {
    type: string        # Event type identifier
    agent_id: string    # Source agent/component
    session_id: string  # Current session identifier
    payload: object     # Event-specific data
    correlation_id: string  # Links related events (optional)
}
```

### Query Requests
```
query: {
    time_range: {
        start: timestamp
        end: timestamp
    }
    filters: {
        event_types: List[string]
        agent_ids: List[string]
        session_id: string
    }
    limit: integer
    stream: boolean  # Real-time streaming flag
}
```

## Outputs

### Stored Event Format
```
{
    event_id: string      # Unique identifier
    timestamp: datetime   # High-precision timestamp
    type: string         # Event type
    agent_id: string     # Source identifier
    session_id: string   # Session context
    payload: object      # Event-specific data
    correlation_id: string  # Related events
    sequence_number: integer  # Global ordering
}
```

### Query Results
```
{
    events: List[Event]
    total_count: integer
    has_more: boolean
    cursor: string  # For pagination
}
```

### Event Stream
For real-time monitoring, provides continuous stream of events matching specified filters.

## Integration Points

### With Asynchronous Task Execution Framework
- Automatically logs all task state transitions
- Captures task metadata and execution details
- Records worker health check results

### With Context Memory System
- Events reference state snapshots in Context Memory
- Checkpoint events link to stored states
- Enables correlation between events and state changes

### With Supervisor Agent
- Logs all orchestration decisions
- Records resource allocation changes
- Captures terminal state determinations

### With Monitoring Services
- Provides event stream for real-time dashboards
- Enables metric calculation from event data
- Supports alerting on specific event patterns

## Behavioral Contracts

The Event Storage system MUST:
- Never lose or modify an event once written
- Maintain strict temporal ordering of events
- Handle high event throughput without blocking agents
- Provide sub-second query response for recent events
- Support event retention policies (e.g., archive after 90 days)
- Ensure event writes are atomic and durable

The Event Storage system MUST NOT:
- Allow direct event deletion or modification
- Block agent execution on event storage
- Expose sensitive information in event payloads
- Consume excessive storage without bounds

## Error Handling

**Storage Failures**
- Buffer events temporarily during storage unavailability
- Log to alternative storage if primary fails
- Alert operators of storage issues
- Never lose events due to transient failures

**Schema Violations**
- Reject malformed events with clear error messages
- Log violations for debugging
- Continue processing valid events

**Query Errors**
- Return partial results with error indicators
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Never return corrupted or incomplete events

## Example Usage Scenarios

### Debugging Hypothesis Generation Failure
```
Query: All events for session_id="xyz" where 
       agent_id="generation_agent" and 
       time_range=[failure_time - 1 hour, failure_time]
       
Purpose: Trace the sequence of events leading to generation failure
```

### Analyzing Tournament Performance
```
Query: All TournamentMatchCompleted events for
       time_range=[start_date, end_date]
       
Purpose: Calculate win rates and Elo rating changes over time
```

### Monitoring System Health
```
Stream: Real-time events where
        type IN ["TaskFailed", "SafetyConcernRaised"]
        
Purpose: Alert operators to system issues immediately
```

## Storage Considerations

While implementation details are outside scope, the specification requires:
- Append-only storage mechanism
- Efficient time-based indexing
- Compression for historical events
- Configurable retention periods
- Export capabilities for analysis

## Privacy and Security

- Event payloads must not contain sensitive research data
- Personal information must be anonymized
- Access to event logs requires authentication
- Audit trail for who queries event data
- Encryption for events containing proprietary information
