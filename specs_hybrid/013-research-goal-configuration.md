# Research Goal Configuration Specification

**Type**: Configuration  
**Interactions**: Natural Language Interface, Supervisor Agent, Context Memory

## Prerequisites
- Read: Natural Language Interface Specification
- Read: Supervisor Agent Specification
- Understand: System Overview and Architecture concepts

## Purpose

The Research Goal Configuration transforms natural language research objectives from scientists into structured configurations that guide the AI Co-Scientist system's hypothesis generation and research processes. It defines how research goals are parsed, validated, and translated into actionable research plans.

## Behavior

The Research Goal Configuration exhibits the following behaviors:

### 1. Natural Language Parsing
- Extracts research objectives from natural language input
- Identifies explicit and implicit constraints
- Recognizes domain-specific terminology and context
- Preserves scientific intent without distortion

### 2. Configuration Structuring
- Transforms unstructured input into structured research plans
- Defines evaluation criteria for hypothesis assessment
- Establishes output format requirements
- Sets computational and resource boundaries

### 3. Constraint Management
- Validates feasibility of specified constraints
- Resolves conflicts between competing requirements
- Applies default safety and ethical constraints
- Maintains laboratory-specific limitations

### 4. Dynamic Refinement
- Accepts modifications during research execution
- Integrates scientist feedback into configuration
- Adjusts parameters based on intermediate results
- Preserves configuration history for context

## Error Handling

### Invalid Configuration Errors
- **Missing Objective**: Prompt for research goal clarification
- **Conflicting Constraints**: Present conflicts and request resolution
- **Infeasible Requirements**: Explain limitations and suggest alternatives
- **Unsafe Goals**: Reject with explanation of concerns

### Runtime Configuration Errors
- **Resource Exceeded**: Adjust scope or request priority guidance
- **No Valid Hypotheses**: Relax constraints with scientist approval
- **Format Incompatibility**: Offer alternative output formats

## Quality Requirements

### Accuracy

## Configuration States

```
ConfigurationState enum {
  "draft"        # Being constructed from input
  "validated"    # Passed validation checks
  "active"       # Currently guiding research
  "refined"      # Modified based on feedback
  "completed"    # Research goal achieved
  "abandoned"    # Cancelled or replaced
}
```

## Success Metrics

Configuration effectiveness measured by:
- **Goal Achievement**: Hypotheses align with objectives
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: All requirements met
- **Scientist Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on results
