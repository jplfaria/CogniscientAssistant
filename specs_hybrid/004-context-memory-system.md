# Context Memory System Specification

**Type**: Infrastructure Component  
**Interactions**: Supervisor Agent, All Specialized Agents, Asynchronous Task Execution Framework

## Prerequisites
- Read: System Overview and Architecture Specification
- Read: Multi-Agent Framework Specification  
- Read: Asynchronous Task Execution Framework Specification
- Understand: State persistence and recovery concepts

## Purpose

The Context Memory System provides persistent storage and retrieval capabilities for the AI Co-Scientist system, enabling iterative computation and scientific reasoning over long time horizons. It maintains the complete system state, facilitates inter-agent communication through shared state, and ensures system resilience through checkpointing and recovery mechanisms.

## System Behavior

The Context Memory System exhibits the following core behaviors:

1. **State Persistence**: Stores and retrieves agent states, system statistics, and intermediate results
2. **Progress Tracking**: Maintains comprehensive metrics about hypothesis generation, reviews, and tournaments  
3. **Feedback Propagation**: Enables agents to access historical data and meta-review feedback
4. **Recovery Support**: Provides checkpointing for system restart after failures
5. **Temporal Continuity**: Preserves reasoning context across multiple computation iterations
6. **Performance Optimization**: Caches frequently accessed data for efficient retrieval

## Core Components

### State Storage
**Purpose**: Central repository for all system state information

**Stored Data Types**:
```
SystemState {
  timestamp: when state was recorded
  iteration_number: current system iteration
  research_goal_config: parsed research plan configuration
  hypothesis_count: total hypotheses generated
  review_queue_depth: hypotheses awaiting review
  tournament_progress: percentage of matches completed
  agent_statistics: performance metrics by agent type
  resource_utilization: compute and memory usage
}

HypothesisState {
  hypothesis_id: unique identifier
  content: hypothesis text and details
  generation_method: how it was created
  elo_rating: current tournament rating
  review_history: all reviews received
  evolution_lineage: parent hypotheses if evolved
  safety_flags: any safety concerns noted
}

AgentState {
  agent_type: Generation | Reflection | Ranking | Evolution | Proximity | Meta-review
  execution_count: number of invocations
  success_rate: percentage of successful completions
  average_execution_time: performance metric
  error_log: recent failures or issues
  feedback_received: meta-review guidance
}

TournamentState {
  match_history: completed tournament matches
  elo_rankings: current hypothesis standings
  debate_transcripts: scientific debate content
  ranking_justifications: why hypotheses won/lost
  proximity_graph: hypothesis similarity relationships
}
```

### State Management Interface
**Purpose**: Standardized API for state operations

**Core Operations**:
```
WriteState(
  namespace: string,
  key: string, 
  value: any,
  timestamp: datetime
) -> success/failure

ReadState(
  namespace: string,
  key: string,
  time_range: optional[start, end]
) -> value | null

QueryState(
  namespace: string,
  filter_criteria: dict,
  limit: int
) -> list[results]

DeleteState(
  namespace: string,
  key: string,
  before_timestamp: datetime
) -> count_deleted
```

### Checkpoint Manager
**Purpose**: Create and restore system snapshots

**Behaviors**:
- Creates periodic checkpoints of complete system state
- Maintains checkpoint history with configurable retention
- Enables selective restoration of specific components
- Validates checkpoint integrity before restoration
- Compresses older checkpoints to save storage

**Checkpoint Operations**:
```
CreateCheckpoint() -> checkpoint_id
RestoreCheckpoint(checkpoint_id) -> success/failure
ListCheckpoints(after_date) -> list[checkpoint_info]
ValidateCheckpoint(checkpoint_id) -> is_valid
PruneCheckpoints(keep_last_n) -> count_removed
```

### Statistics Aggregator
**Purpose**: Compute and store system-wide metrics

**Tracked Metrics**:
- Hypothesis generation rate over time
- Review completion statistics
- Tournament progress and outcomes
- Agent effectiveness comparisons
- Resource usage patterns
- System convergence indicators

**Aggregation Patterns**:
```
UpdateStatistic(
  metric_name: string,
  value: numeric,
  tags: dict
) -> void

GetStatistic(
  metric_name: string,
  aggregation: sum | avg | max | min,
  time_window: duration
) -> numeric

GetStatisticSeries(
  metric_name: string,
  granularity: minute | hour | iteration,
  start_time: datetime,
  end_time: datetime  
) -> time_series_data
```

## Data Access Patterns

### Agent Data Access
Each agent type has specific data access patterns:

**Generation Agent**:
- Reads: Previous hypotheses, meta-review feedback, research goal
- Writes: New hypotheses, generation statistics

**Reflection Agent**:
- Reads: Hypotheses to review, review criteria, meta-review guidance
- Writes: Review results, quality assessments

**Ranking Agent**:
- Reads: Hypothesis pairs, previous match results, proximity data
- Writes: Match outcomes, Elo updates, debate transcripts

**Evolution Agent**:
- Reads: Top-ranked hypotheses, evolution strategies, lineage data
- Writes: Evolved hypotheses, transformation records

**Proximity Agent**:
- Reads: All active hypotheses, similarity metrics
- Writes: Proximity graph, clustering results

**Meta-review Agent**:
- Reads: All reviews, tournament results, system statistics
- Writes: Meta-review feedback, pattern analysis

### Supervisor Data Access
The Supervisor has comprehensive access to:
- All system statistics for decision making
- Task queue state for scheduling
- Agent performance metrics for resource allocation
- Overall progress indicators for termination decisions

## Memory Organization

### Namespace Structure
Data is organized into logical namespaces:
```
/system/config/          - Research goal and configuration
/system/statistics/      - Aggregated system metrics
/system/checkpoints/     - System snapshots

/hypotheses/active/      - Currently evaluated hypotheses
/hypotheses/archived/    - Completed or rejected hypotheses

/agents/[type]/state/    - Agent-specific state data
/agents/[type]/feedback/ - Meta-review guidance

/tournament/matches/     - Match history and results
/tournament/rankings/    - Current Elo standings

/reviews/pending/        - Reviews awaiting processing
/reviews/completed/      - Historical review data
```

### Data Lifecycle

**Creation Phase**:
1. Data created by agents during execution
2. Validated against schema requirements
3. Written to appropriate namespace
4. Indexed for efficient retrieval

**Active Phase**:
1. Frequently accessed data cached in memory
2. Updated as system progresses
3. Monitored for access patterns
4. Replicated for reliability

**Archive Phase**:
1. Inactive data compressed
2. Moved to long-term storage
3. Maintained for historical analysis
4. Pruned based on retention policy

## Integration Protocols

### Agent Integration
Agents access Context Memory through standardized interfaces:
```python
# BAML interface for agents
class ContextMemory:
    function write_hypothesis(hypothesis: Hypothesis) -> bool
    function read_hypothesis(id: string) -> Hypothesis?
    function query_hypotheses(criteria: QueryCriteria) -> list<Hypothesis>

- Checkpoint triggers at task boundaries
- Recovery coordination on restart

### Monitoring Integration
