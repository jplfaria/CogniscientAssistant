# Safety Mechanisms Specification

**Type**: System-wide Process Specification  
**Components**: All Agents, Natural Language Interface, Context Memory, Meta-review Agent

## Prerequisites
- Read: Multi-Agent Framework Specification
- Read: Review Types and Processes Specification
- Read: Natural Language Interface Specification
- Understand: Expert-in-the-Loop Interaction concepts

## Purpose

This specification defines the comprehensive safety mechanisms integrated throughout the AI Co-Scientist system. These mechanisms ensure that scientific research exploration remains safe, ethical, and aligned with human values while maintaining scientific rigor and innovation potential.

## Core Safety Principles

### Layered Defense Strategy
The system implements multiple independent safety layers that operate at different stages of the research process. Each layer can independently prevent unsafe outputs, creating redundancy and robustness.

### Human-Centric Control
Scientists maintain ultimate authority over all research directions and decisions. The system serves as a collaborative tool, not an autonomous agent.

### Transparent Decision-Making
All safety decisions include clear justifications that can be audited and understood by human reviewers.

## Safety Review Points

### 1. Research Goal Entry Safety

**Trigger**: Upon receiving any new research goal from the Natural Language Interface

**Behavior**:
- Immediate automated evaluation of research goal safety
- Assessment of potential dual-use risks
- Detection of queries seeking dangerous knowledge
- Identification of unethical research directions

**Input Format**:
```
SafetyCheckRequest {
  research_goal: string
  context: {
    user_history: list[ResearchGoalId] (optional)
    domain_restrictions: list[string] (optional)
  }
}
```

**Output Format**:
```
SafetyCheckResult {
  is_safe: boolean
  risk_level: RiskLevel (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
  concerns: list[SafetyConcern]
  justification: string
  suggestions: list[string] (for reformulation if unsafe)
}
```

**Action on Unsafe Detection**:
- Research goal rejected before any processing
- User notified with explanation
- Alternative safe formulations suggested when possible

### 2. Hypothesis Generation Safety

**Trigger**: After each hypothesis is generated by Generation Agent

**Behavior**:
- Individual safety evaluation of each hypothesis
- Assessment independent of research goal safety status
- Identification of emergent safety concerns
- Ethical implications analysis

**Safety Criteria**:
- No enabling of harmful applications
- No circumvention of existing safety measures
- No amplification of dangerous capabilities
- Compliance with ethical research standards

**Integration Points**:
- Unsafe hypotheses excluded from tournaments
- No further development of unsafe hypotheses
- Safety flags stored in Context Memory
- Pattern analysis for systemic safety issues

### 3. Continuous Safety Monitoring

**Component**: Meta-review Agent with dedicated safety monitoring capability

**Behavior**:
- Analyzes research trajectory patterns
- Identifies concerning research direction shifts
- Monitors cumulative safety implications
- Alerts on emergent safety patterns

**Monitoring Scope**:
```
SafetyMonitoringState {
  session_id: string
  monitored_items: {
