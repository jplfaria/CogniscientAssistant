**Type**: System Component  
**Interactions**: Event Storage, Context Memory System, All Agents, Meta-review Agent, Natural Language Interface

## Prerequisites
- Read: Event Storage Specification
- Read: Context Memory System Specification
- Read: Session Management Specification
- Read: Hypothesis Generation and Evolution Specification
- Read: Tournament and Elo Rating System Specification
- Understand: Scientific provenance and research lineage concepts

## Purpose

The Research History Tracking system maintains comprehensive records of the scientific discovery process, capturing hypothesis lineage, evolution patterns, review outcomes, and performance metrics. It enables temporal analysis of research progress, provides provenance for scientific claims, and supports the self-improvement feedback loops central to the AI Co-Scientist's design.

## System Behavior

### Hypothesis Lineage Tracking
The system maintains complete genealogy for all hypotheses:
- Tracks parent-child relationships through evolution
- Records generation methods and source materials
- Preserves branching history when hypotheses diverge
- Links combined hypotheses to all source parents
- Maintains immutable hypothesis versions

### Temporal State Management
The system organizes research history into analyzable time periods:
- Partitions data into configurable time buckets (default: 10% intervals)
- Tracks quality metrics across temporal boundaries
- Enables comparison of early vs. late-stage hypotheses
- Supports test-time compute scaling analysis
- Maintains rolling windows for trend detection

### Performance Metric Collection
The system aggregates key performance indicators:
- Hypothesis generation rates by method
- Review pass/fail ratios by type
- Tournament win rates and Elo progression
- Evolution success patterns
- Resource utilization over time

### Provenance Chain Maintenance
The system ensures scientific reproducibility:
- Links hypotheses to source literature
- Tracks all transformations and modifications
- Records expert feedback integration points
- Maintains evidence chains for claims
- Preserves complete decision rationales

## Integration Patterns

### With Event Storage
- Subscribes to all hypothesis-related events
- Queries historical events for analysis
- Correlates events across agents
- Maintains event sequence integrity

### With Context Memory System
- Reads hypothesis state snapshots
- Accesses tournament state history
- Retrieves agent performance metrics
- Links to checkpointed states

### With Meta-review Agent
- Provides historical patterns for feedback
- Supplies performance trends
- Identifies recurring issues
- Enables longitudinal analysis

### With Natural Language Interface
- Formats history for scientist queries
- Generates progress narratives
- Explains hypothesis relationships
- Presents trend visualizations

## Behavioral Contracts

The Research History Tracking system MUST:
- Maintain complete hypothesis lineage without gaps
- Preserve exact temporal ordering of events
- Calculate metrics deterministically from same data
- Support queries across entire research history
- Export data in standard formats for analysis

The Research History Tracking system MUST NOT:
- Modify historical records
- Delete hypothesis relationships
- Aggregate data in lossy ways
- Block real-time operations for analysis
- Expose incomplete lineage chains

## Error Handling

### Missing Lineage Data
- Flag hypotheses with incomplete history
- Attempt reconstruction from events
- Mark uncertainty in provenance chains
- Continue tracking despite gaps

### Metric Calculation Failures
- Use partial data with clear indicators
- Provide confidence intervals
- Log calculation errors
- Fall back to simpler metrics

### Query Performance Issues
- Implement query timeouts
- Return partial results if needed
- Suggest query refinements
- Cache frequently accessed data

## Analysis Capabilities

### Hypothesis Evolution Patterns
- Identify successful evolution strategies
- Track mutation success rates
- Analyze branching factors
- Detect convergent evolution

### Research Velocity Metrics
- Measure hypothesis generation rates over time
- Track time-to-quality improvements
- Analyze compute efficiency gains
- Monitor diversity vs. convergence

### Quality Progression Analysis
- Compare early vs. late hypotheses
- Track Elo rating trajectories
- Measure review pass rate trends
- Identify quality inflection points

## Privacy and Retention

- Anonymize scientist interactions in history
- Apply configurable retention policies
- Archive old sessions appropriately
- Ensure GDPR compliance for personal data
- Maintain audit logs for access

## Example Usage Scenarios

### Tracing Hypothesis Origins
```
Scientist: "Show me the complete history of hypothesis H-4523"
System:
1. Retrieves full lineage tree
2. Identifies original parent hypotheses
3. Shows all evolution steps
4. Lists supporting literature
5. Displays review history
Result: Complete provenance from initial generation through current state
```

### Analyzing Research Progress
```
System: Automatic progress analysis after 100 hypotheses
1. Divides timeline into 10 buckets
2. Calculates metrics per bucket
3. Identifies quality trends
4. Highlights successful strategies
Result: "Hypothesis quality improved 47% from early to late stages"
```

### Finding Successful Patterns
```
Meta-review Agent: "Which evolution strategies work best?"
System:
1. Analyzes all evolution events
2. Correlates with review outcomes
3. Ranks strategies by success rate
4. Identifies context factors
Result: "Grounding enhancement succeeds 73% after failed coherence reviews"
