# Asynchronous Task Execution Framework Specification

**Type**: Infrastructure Framework  
**Interactions**: Supervisor Agent, All Specialized Agents, Worker Processes, Context Memory

## Prerequisites
- Read: System Overview and Architecture Specification
- Read: Multi-Agent Framework Specification
- Understand: Worker process pool and task queue concepts

## Purpose

The Asynchronous Task Execution Framework provides the core infrastructure for distributing and executing agent tasks across a pool of worker processes. This framework enables the AI Co-Scientist system to leverage variable computational resources efficiently, execute multiple agents concurrently, and maintain system resilience through failure recovery mechanisms.

## Framework Behavior

The Asynchronous Task Execution Framework exhibits the following core behaviors:

1. **Task Distribution**: Accepts task submissions and distributes them to available workers
2. **Concurrent Execution**: Runs multiple agent tasks in parallel across worker processes
3. **Resource Management**: Allocates computational resources based on task requirements
4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitors task execution status and completion metrics
5. **Failure Recovery**: Handles task failures gracefully with retry mechanisms
6. **State Coordination**: Ensures consistent state updates through Context Memory

## Core Components

### Task Queue
**Purpose**: Central work distribution and prioritization mechanism

**Behaviors**:
- Maintains ordered queue of pending tasks
- Assigns tasks to workers based on availability
- Tracks task lifecycle (submitted → assigned → executing → completed/failed)
- Enforces task dependencies and ordering constraints
- Provides queue depth and latency metrics

**Task Structure**:
```
Task {
  task_id: unique identifier
  agent_type: Generation | Reflection | Ranking | Evolution | Proximity | Meta-review
  priority: numeric priority level
  parameters: agent-specific parameters
  dependencies: list of prerequisite task_ids
  timeout: maximum execution time
  retry_count: number of retry attempts
  created_at: timestamp
}
```

### Worker Process Pool
**Purpose**: Execution environment for agent tasks

**Behaviors**:
- Maintains pool of worker processes
- Pulls tasks from queue when available
- Executes agent code in isolated environment
- Reports execution results and metrics
- Handles graceful shutdown and restart
- Scales pool size based on workload

**Worker Lifecycle**:
1. Initialize: Start worker process and connect to queue
2. Idle: Wait for task assignment
3. Executing: Run assigned agent task
4. Reporting: Send results to Context Memory
5. Cleanup: Release resources and return to idle

### Task Scheduler
**Purpose**: Intelligent task assignment and resource optimization

**Behaviors**:
- Evaluates system state to determine task priorities
- Assigns weights to different agent types dynamically
- Balances workload across available workers
- Prevents resource starvation
- Optimizes for throughput and latency

**Scheduling Algorithm Behaviors**:
- Prioritize tasks based on research plan configuration
- Adjust agent weights based on iteration progress
- Ensure fair resource allocation among agent types
- Handle priority inversions and dependencies

## Task Execution Patterns

### Standard Execution Flow
1. **Task Submission**
   - Supervisor creates task with parameters
   - Task added to queue with priority
   - Dependencies checked and enforced

2. **Task Assignment**
   - Scheduler selects next task based on priority
   - Available worker claims task
   - Task marked as executing

3. **Task Execution**
   - Worker loads agent code
   - Executes with provided parameters
   - Accesses Context Memory as needed
   - Uses external tools (web search, AI models)

4. **Result Handling**
   - Worker writes results to Context Memory
   - Updates task status in queue
   - Reports execution metrics
   - Triggers dependent tasks if any

### Failure Handling Patterns

**Task-Level Failures**:
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Maximum retry count per task type
- Failure details logged to Context Memory
- Dead letter queue for persistent failures

**Worker-Level Failures**:
- Health check monitoring
- Automatic worker restart
- Task reassignment to healthy workers
- Graceful degradation under load

**System-Level Failures**:
- Periodic state checkpointing
- Recovery from last checkpoint
- Transaction log for state consistency
- Manual intervention escalation

## Resource Management

### Computational Resource Allocation
**Behaviors**:
- Allocate CPU cores based on agent requirements
- Manage memory limits per task
- Enforce execution timeouts
- Monitor resource utilization

**Resource Profiles by Agent Type**:
```
Generation Agent: High memory, moderate CPU, long timeout
Reflection Agent: Moderate memory, low CPU, medium timeout
Ranking Agent: Low memory, high CPU for debates, long timeout
Evolution Agent: Moderate memory, moderate CPU, medium timeout
Proximity Agent: High memory for graph operations, high CPU
Meta-review Agent: Moderate memory, low CPU, short timeout
```

### Scaling Mechanisms

**Horizontal Scaling**:
- Add workers based on queue depth threshold
- Remove idle workers after timeout
- Distribute workers across available machines
- Load balance based on worker capacity

**Vertical Scaling**:
- Adjust resource limits per task dynamically
- Increase timeouts for complex operations
- Allocate more memory for large datasets
- Prioritize critical path tasks

**Test-Time Compute Scaling**:
- Increase iteration count for difficult problems
- Extend execution time for promising hypotheses
- Add more workers during peak generation phases
- Scale based on hypothesis quality metrics

## Communication Protocols

### Task Submission Protocol
**From**: Supervisor Agent  
**To**: Task Queue  
```
SubmitTask(
  agent_type: AgentType,
  parameters: dict,
  priority: int,
  dependencies: list[task_id],
  timeout: int
) -> task_id
```

### Task Claim Protocol
**From**: Worker Process  
**To**: Task Queue  
```
ClaimTask(
  worker_id: string,
  capabilities: list[AgentType]
) -> Task | None
```

### Result Reporting Protocol
**From**: Worker Process  
**To**: Task Queue and Context Memory  
```
ReportResult(
  task_id: string,
  status: Success | Failure | Timeout,
  execution_time: float,
  metrics: dict,
  error_details: string (optional)
) -> acknowledgment
```

### Health Check Protocol
**From**: Task Scheduler  
**To**: Worker Process  
```
HealthCheck() -> {
  status: Healthy | Unhealthy,
  current_task: task_id | None,
  resource_usage: dict
}
```
