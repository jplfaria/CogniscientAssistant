# Session Management Specification

**Type**: System Component  
**Interactions**: Context Memory System, Event Storage, Supervisor Agent, Natural Language Interface, All Agents

## Prerequisites
- Read: Context Memory System Specification
- Read: Event Storage Specification  
- Read: Supervisor Agent Specification
- Understand: Asynchronous Task Execution Framework

## Purpose
The Session Management system maintains the lifecycle of research exploration sessions, enabling long-running scientific hypothesis generation with support for checkpointing, recovery, and expert-in-the-loop collaboration. It provides session isolation, progress tracking, and state management across the multi-agent system.

## System Behavior

### Session Lifecycle Management
The Session Management system orchestrates research sessions through distinct phases:
- **Creation**: Initiates new research sessions from natural language goals
- **Active Processing**: Maintains session state during asynchronous agent operations
- **Checkpointing**: Periodically saves session state for recovery
- **Suspension**: Pauses sessions while preserving state
- **Resumption**: Restores sessions from saved state
- **Termination**: Concludes sessions when research goals are met

### Session State Coordination
The system maintains comprehensive session state including:
- Current research goal and configuration
- Agent task queue status
- Hypothesis collection and rankings
- Tournament progress and Elo ratings
- Meta-review feedback accumulation
- Conversation history with scientist
- Resource allocation and utilization

### Multi-Session Support
The system enables concurrent research explorations:
- Isolates session data and agent operations
- Maintains separate tournaments per session
- Prevents cross-session data contamination
- Manages resource allocation across sessions

## Inputs

  }
}
```

### Session Control Commands
```
{
  "session_id": string,
  "command": enum {
    "suspend",      // Pause session execution
    "resume",       // Resume from suspension
    "checkpoint",   // Force immediate checkpoint
    "terminate"     // End session
  }
}
```

### Session Query Request
```
{
  "session_id": string,
  "query_type": enum {
    "status",       // Current session status
    "progress",     // Progress metrics
    "state",        // Full session state
    "history"       // Event history
  }
}
```

## Outputs

### Session Identifier
```
{
  "session_id": string,           // Unique session identifier
  "created_at": timestamp,        // Session creation time
  "status": string                // Initial status
}
```

### Session Status
```
{
  "session_id": string,
  "status": enum {
    "initializing",    // Setting up session
    "active",          // Processing research goal
    "suspended",       // Temporarily paused
    "checkpointing",   // Saving state
    "terminating",     // Shutting down
    "completed",       // Successfully finished
    "failed"           // Terminated with error
  },
  "progress": {
    "hypotheses_generated": int,
    "reviews_completed": int,
    "tournaments_finished": int,
    "elapsed_time": duration,
    "last_checkpoint": timestamp
  }
}
```

### Session State Snapshot
```
{
  "session_id": string,
  "timestamp": timestamp,
  "research_goal": string,
  "hypotheses": Hypothesis[],
  "rankings": EloRanking[],
  "meta_review": MetaReview,
  "agent_statistics": {
    "generation_success_rate": float,
    "evolution_success_rate": float,
    "active_tasks": int,
    "completed_tasks": int
  }
}
```

## Session Persistence

### Checkpoint Strategy
- Automatic checkpoints at configurable intervals
- Event-driven checkpoints after significant milestones
- Manual checkpoints via scientist request
- Incremental state updates to minimize overhead

### Recovery Mechanism
- Detect incomplete sessions on system startup
- Restore session state from last checkpoint
- Reconstruct task queues from saved state
- Resume agent operations from interruption point

### State Storage
- Session metadata in Event Storage
- Full state snapshots in Context Memory
- Conversation history in session-specific storage
- Hypothesis collection with version tracking

## Integration Patterns

### With Context Memory System
- Writes session state during checkpoints
- Reads session state for recovery
- Maintains session-scoped memory contexts
- Ensures state consistency across agents

### With Event Storage
- Records SessionStarted events
- Tracks SessionCheckpointed events
- Logs SessionCompleted events
- Maintains full session event history

### With Supervisor Agent
- Receives session lifecycle commands
- Provides session context for task distribution
- Reports session resource utilization
- Coordinates checkpoint timing

### With Natural Language Interface
- Maintains conversation continuity
- Preserves scientist interaction history
- Enables mid-session goal refinement
- Supports session-aware responses

## Error Handling

### Session Creation Failures
- Invalid research goal format
- Insufficient resources available
- Scientist authorization failure
- Configuration validation errors

### Runtime Failures
- Agent task failures don't terminate session
- Network interruptions trigger automatic checkpoints
- Resource exhaustion initiates graceful suspension
- Corrupted state detected during recovery

### Recovery Failures
- Missing checkpoint data
- Incompatible state version
- Partial state corruption
- Checkpoint restoration timeout

## Session Boundaries

### Within Scope
- Session lifecycle management
- State persistence and recovery
- Progress tracking and metrics
- Multi-session isolation
- Checkpoint coordination

### Outside Scope
- Agent implementation details
- Hypothesis generation algorithms
- Tournament execution logic
- Research goal parsing
- Scientific validation

## Quality Requirements

### Reliability
- Sessions must survive system restarts
- Checkpoints must be atomic and consistent
- Recovery must restore full session context
- No data loss during normal operations

### Performance
- Checkpoint operations < 5 seconds
- Session creation < 1 second
- State queries < 100ms
- Minimal overhead on agent operations

### Scalability
- Support 100+ concurrent sessions
- Handle sessions with 1000+ hypotheses
- Efficient storage of long-running sessions
- Graceful degradation under load

## Examples

### Creating a New Session
```
Scientist: "Find novel drug targets for Alzheimer's disease"
System:
1. Creates session with unique ID
2. Parses research goal into configuration
3. Initializes Context Memory for session
4. Starts Supervisor with session context
5. Returns session ID to scientist
```

### Mid-Session Interaction
```
Scientist: "Focus on tau protein interactions"
System:
1. Validates session is active
2. Updates research configuration
3. Checkpoints current state
4. Notifies agents of refined goal
5. Continues processing with new focus
```

### Session Recovery
```
System crash during active session
On restart:
1. Scans for incomplete sessions
2. Loads last checkpoint from Context Memory
3. Reconstructs task queues
4. Resumes agent operations
5. Notifies scientist of recovery
